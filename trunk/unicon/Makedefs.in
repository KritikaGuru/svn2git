#  CC       C compiler
#  CFLAGS   flags for building C files
#  CFDYN    additional flags for dynamic functions
#  RLINK    flags for linking run-time system
#  RLIBS    libraries to link with run-time system
#  XLIBS    libraries to link for graphics
#  XPMDEFS  definitions for building XPM library

# Note: -lsocket is not available on some Linux systems,
# but if your system has it you might need to add it to RLIBS
# Useful development flags: -g -Wall -Wno-missing-braces -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer
# -g and -fsanitize=address should also be added to the linker flags
# make sure to also change the optimization to level 0 or 1
