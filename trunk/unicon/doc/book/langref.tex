\chapter{Language Reference}	% use when build the Unicon book
%\section{Introduction}		% use when building UTR8

Unicon is expression-based. Nearly everything is an expression,
including the common \index{control structure}control structures such
as while loops. The only things that are not expressions are
declarations for procedures, methods, variables, records, classes, and
linked libraries.

In the reference, types are listed for parameters and results. If an
identifier is used, any type is allowed. For results,
\index{generator}generator expressions are further annotated with an
asterisk (\textsf{\textbf{*}}) and non-generators that can
\index{expression failure}fail are annotated with a question mark
(\textsf{?}). A question mark by itself (short for \textsf{null?})
denotes a predicate whose success or failure is what matters; the
predicate return value (\textsf{\&null}) is not significant.

\section{Immutable Types}

Unicon's immutable types are integers, real numbers,
strings, and csets. Values of these types cannot change. Operators and
functions on immutable types produce new values rather than modify
existing ones. The simplest expressions are literal values, which occur
only for immutable types. A literal value evaluates to itself.

\subsection{Integer}

Integers are of arbitrary precision. Decimal \index{integer}integer
literals are contiguous sequences of the digits 0 through 9, optionally
preceded by a + or - sign.  Suffixes K, M, G, T, or P multiply
a literal by 1024, 1024\^{}2, 1024\^{}3, 1024\^{}4, and
1024\^{}5, respectively.

Radix integer literals use the format
\textit{radix}R\textit{digits}, where \textit{radix} is a base in the
range 2 through 36, and \textit{digits} consists of one or more
numerals in the supplied radix. After values 0-9, the letters A-Z are
used for values 10-35. Radix literals are case insensitive, unlike the
rest of the language, so the R may be upper or lower case, as may the
following alphabetic digits.

\subsection{Real}

\index{real number}Reals are double-precision floating-point values.
Real decimal literals are contiguous sequences of the digits 0 through
9, with a decimal point (a period) somewhere within or at either end of
the digits. Real exponent literals use the format
\textit{number}E\textit{integer}; E may be upper or lower case.

\subsection{String}

\index{string}Strings are sequences of 0 or more characters, where a
character is a value with a platform-dependent size and symbolic
representation. On platforms with multi-byte character sets, multiple
Icon characters represent a single symbol using a platform-dependent
encoding.
String literals consist of 0 or more characters enclosed in double
quotes. A string literal may include escape sequences that use multiple
characters to encode special characters. The escape sequences are given
in Table A-1. Incomplete \index{string!multi-line}string literals may
be continued on the next line if the last character on a line is an
underscore (\_). In that case, the underscore, the newline, and any
whitespace at the beginning of the next line are not part of the string
literal.

\subsection{Cset}

\index{cset}Csets are sets of 0 or more characters. Cset literals
consist of 0 or more characters enclosed in single quotes. As with
strings, a \index{cset literal}cset literal may include escape
sequences that use multiple characters to encode special characters.

\section{Mutable Types}

Mutable types' values may be altered. Changes to a
\index{mutable value}mutable value affect its allocated memory or its
associated OS resource. Mutable types include lists, tables,
sets, records, objects, and files, including windows, network
connections and \index{database}databases. These types are described in
the entries for \index{constructor}constructors that
create them. \index{structure types}Structure types hold
collections of elements that may be of arbitrary, mixed type.

\subsection{List}

\index{list}Lists are dynamically sized, ordered sequences of zero or
more values. They are constructed by function, by an explicit
operator, or implicitly by a call to a variable argument procedure.
They change size by \index{stack}stack and \index{queue}queue functions.

\subsection{Table}

\index{table}Tables are dynamically sized, unordered mappings from keys
to elements. They are constructed by function. The keys may be of
arbitrary, mixed type.

\subsection{Set}

\index{set}Sets are unordered collections. They are constructed by function.

\subsection{Record}

\index{record}Records are ordered, fixed length sequences of elements
accessed via named fields.

\subsection{Object}

\index{object}Objects are ordered, fixed length sequences of elements that may
be accessed via named fields and methods. Accessing an object's fields from
outside its methods (using it as a record) is legal but deprecated.

\subsection{File}

\index{file}Files are system resources corresponding to data on secondary
storage, areas on users' displays, network connections, or
\index{database}databases. Operations on files cause input or output side
effects on the system outside of the program execution.

\section{Variables}

Variables are names for locations in memory where values can be stored.
Values are stored in variables by \index{assignment}assignment
operators. A \index{variable}variable name begins with a letter or
underscore, followed by zero or more letters, underscores, or digits. A
variable name cannot be the same as one of Icon's
reserved words, nor can it be the same as one of
Icon's keywords if it follows an adjacent ampersand
character. Variables can hold values of any type, and may hold
different types of values at different times during program execution.

There are four kinds of variables: \index{global}global,
\index{local}local, \index{static, and class}static, and class. Global,
local, and static variables are declared by introducing one of the
reserved words (\textsf{global}, \textsf{local}, or \textsf{static})
followed by a comma-separated list of variable names. Global variables
are declared outside of any procedure or method body, while local and
static variables are declared at the beginning of procedure and method
bodies. Local and static variable names may be followed by
an assignment operator and an initial value; otherwise variables
other than procedure and class names begin with the value
\texttt{\&null}.

\index{aliasing}\textit{Aliasing} occurs when two or more variables
refer to the same value, such that operations on one variable might
affect the other. Aliasing is a common source of program bugs.
Variables holding integer, real, string, or cset values are never
aliased, because those types are immutable.

\subsection{Global}

Global variables are visible everywhere in the program, and exist at the same
location for the entire program execution. Declaring a procedure declares a
global variable initialized to the procedure value that corresponds to the
code for that procedure.

\subsection{Local}

Local variables exist and are visible within a single procedure or method only
for the duration of a single procedure invocation, including suspensions and
resumptions, until the procedure returns, fails, or is \textit{vanquished} by
the return or failure of an ancestor invocation while it is suspended.
Undeclared variables in any \index{scope}scope are implicitly local, but this
dangerous practice should be avoided in large programs.

Variables that are declared as \textit{parameters} are local variables
that are preinitialized to the values of actual parameters at the time
of a procedure or method invocation. The semantics of parameter passing
are the same as those of assignment.

\subsection{Static}

Static variables are visible only within a single procedure or method, but exist
at the same location for the entire program execution. The value stored in a
static variable is preserved between multiple calls to the procedure in which it
is declared.

\subsection{Class}

Class variables are visible within the methods of a declared class.  Class
variables are created for each \index{instance!class}instance (object) of the
class. The lifespan of class variables is the life span of the instance to which
they belong. The value stored in a class variable is preserved between multiple
calls to the methods of the class in which it is declared.

\section{Keywords}

Keywords are names with global \index{scope}scope and special semantics within
the language. They begin with an ampersand character. Some keywords are names of
common constant values, while others are names of variables that play a special
role in Icon's \index{control structure}control structures. The
name of the keyword is followed by a : if it is read-only, or a := if it is a
variable, followed by the type of value the keyword holds.

\section{Control Structures and Reserved Words}

Unicon has many \index{reserved word}reserved words. Some are used in
declarations, but most are used in \index{control structure}control
structures. This section summarizes the syntax and semantics
introduced by all the reserved words of the language. The reserved

syntax uses square brackets for optional items and an asterisk for
items that may repeat.

\section{Operators and Built-in Functions}

Icon's built-ins operators and functions utilize
automatic type conversion to provide flexibility and ease of
programming. Automatic \index{type conversion}type \index{conversion,
type}conversions are limited to integer, real, string, and cset data
types. Conversions to a "number" will
convert to either an integer or a real, depending whether the value to
be converted has a decimal. Conversions between numeric types and csets
go through an intermediate conversion to a string value and are not
generally useful.

Indexes start at 1. Index 0 is the position after the last element of a
string or list. Negative \index{index, subscript}indexes are positions
relative to the end. Subscripting operators and string analysis
functions can take two indices to specify a section of the string or
list. When two indices are supplied, they select the same string
section whether they are in ascending or descending order.

\subsection{Operators}

\index{operators}The result types of operators are the same as the
operand types except as noted.

\subsection{Unary operators}

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf ! x : any* \hfill generate elements}

\noindent
\index{generate elements}The \index{generate operator "!x}generate
operator produces the elements of \texttt{x}. If
\texttt{x} is a string variable or refers to a structure value, the
generated elements are variables that may be assigned. \texttt{!i} is
equivalent to \texttt{(1 to i)} for integer \texttt{i}. List, record,
string, and file elements are generated in order, with string elements
consisting of one-letter substrings. Set and table elements are
generated in an undefined order. If \texttt{x} is a messaging
connection to a POP server, \texttt{!x} produces complete messages as
strings. Other types of files, including network connections, produce
elements consisting of text lines.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf / x \hfill null test}
\index{null test /x}

\noindent
{\bf {\textbackslash} x \hfill nonnull test}
\index{nonnull test {\textbackslash}x}

\noindent
The null and nonnull tests succeed
and produce their operand if it satisfies the test.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf {}- number \hfill negate}

\noindent {\bf + number \hfill numeric identity}

\noindent
Negation reverses the sign of its operand. Numeric identity does not
change its operand's value other than to convert to a
required numeric type.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf = string \hfill tab/match}

\noindent
\index{tab/match ( =s )}The tab/match operator is equivalent to calling
\texttt{tab(match(s))} on its operand.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf * x : integer \hfill size}

\noindent
The \index{size operator}size operator returns the number of elements in
string, cset or structure \texttt{x}.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf . x : x \hfill dereference}

\noindent
The \index{dereference}dereference operator returns the value
\texttt{x}.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf ? x : any \hfill random element}

\noindent
The \index{random!operator, ?x}random operator produces a random element
from \texttt{x}. If \texttt{x} is a string, \texttt{?x} produces a
random one-letter substring. The result is a variable that may be
assigned. If \texttt{x} is a positive integer, \texttt{?x} produces a
random integer between 1 and x.  \texttt{?0} returns a real in the
range from 0.0-1.0.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf {\textbar} x : x* \hfill repeated alternation}

\noindent
The repeated \index{alternation, repeated}alternation operator generates
results from evaluating its operand over and over again in an infinite
loop.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \~{} cset \hfill cset complement}

\noindent
The \index{complement, cset}complement operator returns a cset
consisting of all characters not in its operand.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \^{} co{}-expression \hfill refresh co{}-expression}

\noindent
\index{refresh, co-expression}The refresh operator restarts a
co-expression so the next time it is activated it will begin with its
first result.

\subsection{Binary operators}

\index{binary operator}Most binary operators may be augmented with an
\index{assignment!augmented}assignment. If such an operator is followed
by a \texttt{:=} the left operand must be a variable, and the
expression \texttt{x }\texttt{\textit{op}}\texttt{:= y} is equivalent
to \texttt{x := x }\texttt{\textit{op}}\texttt{ y}. For example,
\texttt{x +:= 5} is equivalent but faster than the expression
\ \texttt{x := x+5.}

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \textit{number1} \^{} \textit{number2} \hfill power}
\index{power, exponent \^{}}

\index{modulo \%}

\noindent {\bf \textit{number1} + \textit{number2} \hfill add}

\noindent {\bf \textit{number1} - \textit{number2} \hfill subtract}

\noindent
The \index{arithmetic operator}arithmetic operators may be augmented.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf set1 ** set2 \hfill intersection}

\noindent {\bf set1 ++ set2 \hfill union}

\noindent {\bf set1 -{}- set2 \hfill difference}

\noindent
The set operators work on sets or csets. They may be augmented.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}

\noindent {\bf x . name \hfill field}
\index{field, record or class}

\noindent {\bf \textit{object} . name (params) \hfill method invocation}
\index{method!invocation}

\noindent {\bf \textit{object} \$ superclass .name (params) \hfill
superclass method invocation}
\index{superclass}

\noindent
The field operator selects field name out of a record,
object, or package. For objects, \textit{name} may be a method, in
which case the field operator is being used as part of a method
invocation. Superclass method invocation consists of a dollar sign and
superclass name prior to the field operator.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf number1 = number2 \hfill equal}

\noindent
\index{equal!numeric =}
{\bf number1 \~{}= number2 \hfill not equal}

\noindent {\bf number1 {\textless} number2 \hfill less than}

\noindent {\bf number1 {\textless}= number2 \hfill less or equal}

\noindent {\bf number1 {\textgreater} number2 \hfill greater than}

\index{string!comparison}\index{equal!string ==}

\noindent {\bf string1 \~{}== string2 \hfill string not equal}

\noindent
{\bf string1 {\textless}{\textless} string2 \hfill string less than}

\noindent {\bf string1 {\textless}{\textless}= string2 \hfill
string less or equal}

\noindent {\bf string1 {\textgreater}{\textgreater} string2 \hfill
string greater than}

\noindent {\bf string1 {\textgreater}{\textgreater}= string2 \hfill
string greater or equal}

\noindent {\bf x1 === x2 \hfill equivalence}
\index{equal!reference ===}

\noindent {\bf x1 \~{}=== x2 \hfill non equivalence}

\noindent
Relational operators produce their right operand if they succeed. They
may be augmented.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}

\noindent {\bf var := expr \hfill assign}

\noindent {\bf var1 :=: var2 \hfill swap}
\index{swap}

\noindent {\bf var {\textless}- expr \hfill reversible assignment}
\index{assignment!reversible}\index{reversible assignment}

\noindent {\bf var1 {\textless}-{\textgreater} var2 \hfill reversible swap}
\index{reversible swap}

\noindent The several \index{assignment}assignment
operators all require variables for their left operands, and swap
operators also require variables for their right operands.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf string ? expr \hfill scan string}

\noindent
\index{scan string}String scanning evaluates \textit{expr}
with \texttt{\&subject} equal to string and \texttt{\&pos} starting at
1. It may be augmented.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf x ! y \hfill apply}

\noindent
\index{bang!binary}The binary bang (exclamation) operator calls x,
using y as its parameters.  x may be a procedure, or the string name of
a procedure.  y is a list or record.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf [x] @ co-expression \hfill activate co-expression}
\index{activate co-expression}

\noindent The activate operator transfers execution
control from the current co-expression to its right operand
co-expression. The transmitted value is \texttt{x}, or \texttt{\&null}
if no left operand is supplied. Activation may be augmented.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf [x] @$>$ [y] \hfill send message}
\index{activate co-expression} \linebreak
\noindent {\bf [x] @$>>$ [y] \hfill blocking send message}

\noindent The send operator places a message in another thread's public
inbox, or in the current thread's public outbox. The normal version fails
if the box is full; the blocking version waits for space to become
available.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf [x] $<$@ [y] \hfill receive message}
\index{activate co-expression} \linebreak
\noindent {\bf [x] $<<$@ [y] \hfill blocking receive message}

\noindent The receive operator obtains a message from another thread's public
outbox, or the current thread's public inbox. The normal version fails
if the box is empty; the blocking version waits for a message to become
available.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf string1 {\textbar}{\textbar} string2 \hfill concatenation}

\noindent
{\bf list1 {\textbar}{\textbar}{\textbar} list2 \hfill list concatenation}

\noindent The \index{concatenation}concatenation operators produce new values
containing a copy of the left operand followed by a copy of the right
operand. They may be augmented.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf x1 \& x2 \hfill conjunction}

\noindent
{\bf expr1 {\textbar} expr2 \hfill alternation}

\noindent
The \index{conjunction \&}conjunction operator produces \texttt{x2} if
\texttt{x1} succeeds. The \index{alternation operator ( {\textbar}
)}alternation operator produces the results of \texttt{expr1} followed
by the results of \texttt{expr2}; it is a \index{generator}generator.
These operators may be augmented.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf x1 {\textbackslash} integer \hfill limitation}

\noindent
The \index{limitation {\textbackslash}}limitation operator fails if it
is resumed after its left operand has produced a number of results
equal to its right operand.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf ( expr [, expr]* ) \hfill mutual evaluation}
\index{mutual evaluation}

\noindent {\bf p ( expr [, expr]* ) \hfill invocation}
\index{invocation}

\noindent
By themselves, \index{parentheses}parentheses are used
to override operator precedence in surrounding expressions. A
comma-separated list of expressions is evaluated left to right, and
fails if any operand fails. Its value is the right of the rightmost
operand.

When preceded by an operand, parentheses form an \index{call,
procedure}invocation. The operand may be a procedure, a method, a
string that is converted to a procedure name, or an integer that
selects the parameter to use as the result of the entire expression.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}

\noindent {\bf \textbf{[} \textbf{]} \hfill empty list creation}
\index{empty list}

\noindent {\bf \textbf{[} expr [, expr]* \textbf{]} \hfill list creation}
\index{list creation}

\noindent {\bf \textbf{[:} expr \textbf{:]} \hfill list comprehension}
\index{list creation}

\noindent {\bf expr1 \textbf{[} expr2 [, expr]* \textbf{]} \hfill subscript}
\index{subscript}

\noindent {\bf expr1 \textbf{[} expr2 : expr3 \textbf{]} \hfill subsection}
\index{slice}\index{subsection}

\noindent {\bf expr1 \textbf{[} expr2 +: expr3 \textbf{]} \hfill
forward relative subsection}

\noindent {\bf expr1 \textbf{[} expr2 -: expr3 \textbf{]} \hfill
backward relative subsection}

\noindent
With no preceding operand, square brackets create and initialize lists.
Initializer values are comma-separated, except in list comprehension
where the expression's values (obtained as if by \textbf{every}) are used
to provide the initial list elements.
When preceded by an operand, square brackets form a subscript or
subsection. Multiple comma-separated subscript operands are equivalent
to separate subscript operations with repeating square brackets, so
\texttt{x[y,z]} is equivalent to \texttt{x[y][z]}.

Subscripting selects an element from a structure and allows that element
to be assigned or for its value to be used. Lists and strings are
subscripted using 1-based integer indices, tables are subscripted using
arbitrary keys, and records may be subscripted by either string
fieldname or 1-based integer index. Message connections may be
subscripted by string header to obtain server responses; POP
connections may also be subscripted by 1-based integer message numbers.

Subsectioning works on strings and lists. For strings, the subsection is
a variable if the string was a variable, and
\index{assignment!substring}assignment to the subsection makes the
\index{variable}
variable hold the new, modified string constructed by replacing the subsection.
For lists, a subsection is a new
list that contains a copy of the elements from the original list.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf expr1 ; expr2 \hfill bound expression}

\noindent
A semicolon bounds \texttt{expr1}. Once \texttt{expr2} is entered,
\texttt{expr1} cannot be resumed for more results. The result of
\texttt{expr2} is the result of the entire expression. \index{semicolon
insertion}Semicolons are automatically inserted at ends of lines
wherever it is syntactically allowable to do so. This results in many
\textit{implicitly }\index{bounded expressions}\textit{bounded}
expressions.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \{ expr [; expr]* \} \hfill compound expression}
\index{compound expression}

\noindent {\bf p \{ expr [; expr]* \} \hfill
programmer defined control structure}
\index{programmer defined control structure}\index{control
structure!programmer defined}

\noindent
Curly brackets typically cause a sequence
of bounded expressions to be treated as a single expression. Preceded
by a procedure value, curly brackets introduce a programmer defined
control structure in which a co-expression is created for each
argument; the procedure is called with these co-expressions as its
parameters, and can determine for itself whether, and in what order, to
activate its parameters to obtain values.

\subsection{Built-in functions}

Unicon's \index{built-in functions}built-in functions
are a key element of its ease of learning and use. They provide
substantial functionality in a consistent and easily memorized manner.

In addition to automatic type conversion, built-in functions make
extensive use of optional parameters with default values. Default
values are indicated in the function descriptions, with the exception
of string scanning functions. \index{default parameters!string scanning
functions}String scanning functions end with three parameters that
default to the string \texttt{\&subject}, the integer \texttt{\&pos},
and the end of string (0) respectively. The position argument defaults
to 1 when the string argument is supplied rather than defaulted.

\bigskip

\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}

\bigskip

\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf any(c, s, i, i) : integer? \hfill cset membership}

\noindent
\index{any()}\index{cset membership}String scanning function
\texttt{any(c,s,i1,i2)} produces \texttt{i1+1} if \texttt{s[i1:i2][1]}
is in cset \texttt{c}, but fails otherwise.

\bigskip

\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf args(x,i) : any \hfill number of arguments}

\noindent
\index{args(p)}\texttt{args(p)} produces the number of arguments
expected by procedure \texttt{p}. If \texttt{p} takes a variable number
of arguments, \texttt{args(p)} returns a negative number to indicate
that the final argument is a list conversion of an arbitrary number of
arguments. For example, \texttt{args(p)} for a procedure \texttt{p}
with formal parameters \texttt{(x, y, z[ ])} returns a \texttt{{}-3}.

The first group describes the set of mode bits to be changed: \texttt{u}
is the owner set, \texttt{g} is the group and \texttt{o} is the set of
all others. The character \texttt{a} designates all the fields. The
operator (\texttt{+-=}) describes the operation to be performed:
\texttt{+} adds a permission, \texttt{{}-} removes a permission, and
\texttt{=} sets a permission. The permissions themselves are: 

\ \ \ \ \ \texttt{r} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ read\\
 \ \ \ \ \texttt{w} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ write\\
 \ \ \ \ \texttt{x} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ execute\\

If the first group is missing, then it is treated as
"all" except that any bits in the
user's umask will not be modified in the mode. Not all
platforms make use of all mode bits described here; the mode bits that
are used is a property of the filesystem on which the file resides.

\noindent
\index{open file}\texttt{open(s1, s2, ...)} opens a file named
\texttt{s1} with mode \texttt{s2} and attributes given in trailing
arguments. The modes recognized by \texttt{open()} are: 

\ \ \ \ \ \texttt{"a"\ \ \ \ }append; write
after current contents\\
 \ \ \ \ \texttt{"b"\ \ \ \ }open for both
reading and writing (b does not mean binary mode!)\\
 \ \ \ \ \texttt{"c"\ \ \ \ }create a new
file and open it\\
 \ \ \ \ \texttt{"d"\ \ \ \ }open a
[NG]\index{DBM}DBM database\\

 \ \ \ \ \texttt{"w"\ \ \ \ }write

Directories may only be opened for reading, and produce the names of all
files, one per line. Pipes may be opened for reading or writing, but
not both.

When opening a network socket: the first argument \texttt{s1} is the
name of the socket to connect. If \texttt{s1} is of the form
"s:i", it is an Internet domain socket on
host s and port i; otherwise, it is the name of a Unix
domain socket. If the host name is null, it represents the current
host. Mode "n" allows an optional third parameter,
an integer timeout (in milliseconds) after which \texttt{open()} fails
if no connection has been established by that time.

For a UDP socket, there is not really a connection, but any writes to
that file will send a datagram to that address, so that the address
doesn't have to be specified each time. Also,
\texttt{read()} or \texttt{reads()} cannot be performed on a UDP
socket; use receive. UDP sockets must be in the INET domain; the
address must have a colon. 

For a DBM database, only one modifier character may be used: if
\texttt{s1} is \texttt{"dr"} it indicates
that the database should be opened in read-only mode. 

The filename argument is a Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) when opening
a messaging connection. Arguments after the mode
"m" are sent as headers. The HTTP
User-Agent header defaults to "Unicon
Messaging/10.0" and Host defaults to the host and port
indicated in the URI. The SMTP From: header obtains its default from a
UNICON\_USERADDRESS environment variable if it is present.

For 2D and 3D windows, attribute values may be specified in the
following arguments to \texttt{open()}. \texttt{open()} fails if a
window cannot be opened or an attribute cannot be set to a requested
value.

\noindent {\bf proc(any, i:1, C) : procedure? \hfill convert to procedure}

\noindent
\index{proc(s,i)}\texttt{proc(s,i)} converts \texttt{s} to a procedure
if that is possible. Parameter \texttt{i} is used to resolve ambiguous
string names; it must be either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If \texttt{i} is 0, a
built-in function is returned if it is available, even if the global
identifier by that name has been assigned differently. If \texttt{i} is
1, 2, or 3, the procedure for an operator with that number of operands
is produced. For example,
\texttt{proc("-",2)} produces the procedure
for subtraction, while
\ \ \texttt{proc("-")} produces the
procedure for unary negation. \texttt{proc(C,i)} returns the procedure
activated \texttt{i} levels up with \texttt{C}. \texttt{proc(p, i, C)}
returns procedure \texttt{p} if it belongs to the program which created
co-expression \texttt{C}.

\noindent {\bf reads(f:\&input, i:1) : string? \hfill read characters}

\noindent
\index{reads(f,i)}\texttt{reads(f,i)} reads up to \texttt{i} characters
from file \texttt{f}. It fails on end of file. If \texttt{f} is a
network connection, \texttt{reads()} returns as soon as it has input
available, even if fewer than \texttt{i} characters were delivered. If
\texttt{i} is -1, \texttt{reads()} reads and produces the entire file

\noindent
\index{seek(f,i)}\texttt{seek(f,i)} seeks to offset \texttt{i} in file
\texttt{f}, if it is possible. If \texttt{f} is a regular file,
\texttt{i} must be an integer. If \texttt{f} is a database, \texttt{i}
seeks a position within the current set of selected rows. The position
is selected numerically if \texttt{i} is convertible to an integer;
otherwise \texttt{i} must be convertible to a string and the position
is selected associatively by the primary key.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf select(x1, x2, ?) : list \hfill files with available input}

\noindent
\texttt{select(files?, timeout)} waits for a input to become available
on any of several files, typically network connections or windows. Its
arguments may be files or lists of files, ending with an optional
integer timeout value in milliseconds. It returns a list of those files
among its arguments that have input waiting.

If the final argument to \index{select()}\texttt{select()} is an
integer, it is an upper bound on the time elapsed before select
returns. A timeout of 0 causes \texttt{select()} to return immediately
with a list of files on which input is currently pending. If no files
are given, \texttt{select()} waits for its timeout to expire. If no
timeout is given, \texttt{select()} waits forever for available input
on one of its file arguments. Directories and databases cannot be

\index{sort(x, i)}\texttt{sort(x, i)} sorts structure \texttt{x}. If
\texttt{x} is a table, parameter \texttt{i} is the sort method. If
\texttt{i} is 1 or 2, the table is sorted into a list of lists of the
form [key, value]. If \texttt{i} is 3 or 4, the table is sorted into a
list of alternating keys and values. Sorting is by keys for odd-values
of \texttt{i}, and by table element values for even-values of
\texttt{i}.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}

file object. The return value is of type: \texttt{record
posix\_stat(dev, ino, mode, nlink, uid, gid, rdev, size, atime, mtime,
ctime, blksize, blocks, symlink)}. Many of these fields are POSIX
specific, but a number are supported across platforms, such as the
\index{file size}file size in bytes (the \texttt{size} field), access
permissions (the \texttt{mode} field), and the last modified time (the

The \texttt{atime}, \texttt{mtime}, and \texttt{ctime} fields are
integers that may be formatted with the \texttt{ctime()} and
\texttt{mtime()} functions. The mode is a string similar to the long

execute system command}

\noindent
\index{system command}\texttt{system(x, f1, f2, f3, waitflag)} launches
execution of a program in a separate process. \texttt{x} can be either
a string or a list of strings. In the former case, whitespace is used
to separate the arguments and the command is processed by the
platform's command interpreter. In the second case,
each member of the list is an argument and the second and subsequent
list elements are passed unmodified to the program named in the first
element of the list.

The three file arguments are files that will be used for the new
process' standard input, standard output and standard
error. The return value is the exit status from the process. If the
\texttt{waitflag} argument is
\texttt{"nowait"}, \texttt{system()}

string. This function reverses its effects by resetting the position to
its old value if it is resumed.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf table(k,v, ..., x) : table \hfill create table}

\noindent
\index{table(x)}\texttt{table(x)} creates a table with default value
\texttt{x}. If \texttt{x} is a mutable value such as a list, all
references to the default value refer to the \textit{same} value, not a
separate copy for each key. Given more than one argument,
\texttt{table(k,v,...x)} takes alternating keys and values and
populates the table with these initial contents.

\subsection{Graphics functions}

The names of built-in graphics functions begin with upper case. The built-in
graphics functions are listed here. These functions are more thoroughly
described in [Griswold98]. Extensive procedure and class libraries for graphics
are described in [Griswold98] and in Appendix B.  In 2D, arguments named
\texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are pixel locations in zero-based integer
coordinates. In 3D windows coordinates are given using real numbers, and
functions by default take three coordinates (\texttt{x,y,z}) per
vertex. Attribute \texttt{dim} can be set to 2 or 4, changing most 3D functions
to take vertices in a (\texttt{x,y}) or (\texttt{x,y,z,w}) format. Arguments
named \texttt{row} and \texttt{col} are cursor locations in one-based integer
text coordinates. Most functions' first parameter named
\texttt{w} defaults to \texttt{\&window} and the window argument can be omitted
in the default case.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Active() : window \hfill produce active window}

\noindent
\texttt{Active()} returns a window that has one or more events pending.
If no window has an event pending, \texttt{Active()} blocks and waits
for an event to occur. \texttt{Active()} starts with a different
window on each call in order to avoid window
"starvation". \texttt{Active()} fails if
no windows are open.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Alert() : window \hfill alert the user}

\noindent
\texttt{Alert()} produces a visual flash or audible beep that signifies
to the user the occurrence of some notable event in the application.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Bg(w,s) : string \hfill background color}

\noindent
\texttt{Bg(w)} retrieves the background color. \texttt{Bg(w,s)} sets the
background color by name, rgb, or mutable color value. \texttt{Bg()}
fails if the background cannot be set to the requested color.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf Clip(w,x:0,y:0,width:0,height:0) : window \hfill clip to rectangle}

\noindent
\texttt{Clip(w,x,y,width,height)} clips output to a rectangular area
within the window. If \texttt{width} is 0, the clip region extends
from \texttt{x} to the right side of the window. If \texttt{height}
is 0, the clip region extends from \texttt{y} to the bottom of the
window.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Clone(w,s,...) : window \hfill clone context}

\noindent
\texttt{Clone(w)} produces a new window binding in which a new graphics
context is copied from \texttt{w} and bound to
\texttt{w}'s canvas. Additional string arguments
specify attributes of the new binding, as in \texttt{WAttrib()}. If the
first string argument is
\texttt{{\textquotedblleft}g{\textquotedblright}} or
\texttt{{\textquotedblleft}gl{\textquotedblright}}, \texttt{Clone()}
binds the new context to a subwindow with separate canvas and input
queue inside of and relative to \texttt{w}. \texttt{Clone()} fails if
an attribute cannot be set to a requested value.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Color(w, i, s,...) : window \hfill set mutable color}

\noindent
\texttt{Color(w,i)} produces the current setting of mutable color
\texttt{i}. \texttt{Color(w,i,s,...)} sets the color map entries
identified by \texttt{i[j]} to the corresponding colors \texttt{s[j]}.
\ See [Griswold98].

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf ColorValue(w, s) : string \hfill convert color name to rgb}

\noindent
\texttt{ColorValue(w,s)} converts the string color \texttt{s} into a
string with three comma-separated 16-bit integer values denoting the
color's RGB components. \texttt{ColorValue()} fails if
string \texttt{s} is not a valid name or recognized decimal or hex
encoding of a color.

\texttt{CopyArea(w1,w2,x,y,width,height,x2,y2)} copies a rectangular
region within \texttt{w1} defined by
\texttt{x},\texttt{y},\texttt{width},\texttt{height} to window
\texttt{w2} at offset \texttt{x2},\texttt{y2}. \texttt{CopyArea()}
returns \texttt{w1}. \texttt{\&window} is not a default for this
function. The default copies all of \texttt{w1}.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Couple(w1, w2) : window \hfill couple window to context}

\noindent
\texttt{Couple(w1,w2)} produces a new value that binds the window

\texttt{DrawArc(w,x,y,width,height,a1,a2,...)} draws arcs or ellipses.
\ Each is defined by six integer coordinates. \texttt{x}, \texttt{y},
\texttt{width} and \texttt{height} define a bounding rectangle around
the arc; the center of the arc is the point
\texttt{(x+(width)/2,y+(height)/2)}. Angles are specified in radians.
\ Angle \texttt{a1} is the starting position of the arc, where 0.0 is
the 3 o'clock position and the positive direction is
counter-clockwise. Angle \texttt{a2} is not the end position, but
rather specifies the direction and extent of the arc.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf DrawCircle(w, x, y, radius, a1:0.0, a2:2*\&pi, ...) :

disk or partial disk centered at (\texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, \texttt{z})
on 3D window \texttt{w}. The inner circle has radius \texttt{r1} and
the outer circle has radius \texttt{r2}. The parameters \texttt{a1} and
\texttt{a2} are optional. If they are specified, a partial disk is
drawn with a starting angle \texttt{a1} and sweeping angle \texttt{a2}.
The display list element is returned.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf DrawImage(w, x, y, s) : window \hfill draw bitmapped figure}

\texttt{s} at location \texttt{x,y}.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf DrawLine(w, x1, y1, z1 ...) : window [list] \hfill draw line}

\noindent
\texttt{DrawLine(w,x1,y1,...,xn,yn)} draws lines between each adjacent
\texttt{x,y} pair of arguments. In 3D, \texttt{DrawLine()} takes from
2-4 coordinates per vertex and returns the list that represents the
lines on the display list for refresh purposes.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf DrawPoint(w, x1, y1, ...) : window [list] \hfill draw point}

\noindent
\texttt{DrawPoint(w,x1,y1,...,xn,yn)} draws points. In 3D,
\texttt{DrawPoint()} takes from 2-4 coordinates per vertex and returns

purposes.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf DrawPolygon(w, x1, y1, [z1,] ...) : window [list] \hfill draw polygon}

\noindent
\texttt{DrawPolygon(w,x1,y1,...,xn,yn)} draws a polygon. In 3D\texttt{,
DrawPolygon()} takes from 2-4 coordinates per vertex and returns the
list that represents the polygon on the display list for refresh
purposes.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf DrawRectangle(w, x1, y1, width1, height1 ...) : window \hfill
draw rectangle}

\noindent
\texttt{DrawRectangle(w,x1,y1,width1,height1,...)} draws rectangles.
Arguments \texttt{width} and \texttt{height} define the perceived size
of the rectangle; the actual rectangle drawn is \texttt{width+1} pixels
wide and \texttt{height+1} pixels high.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf DrawSegment(w, x1, y1, [z1,] ...) : window [list] \hfill draw line segment}

\noindent
\texttt{DrawSegment(w,x1,y1,...,xn,yn)} draws lines between alternating
\texttt{x,y} pairs in the argument list. In 3D, \texttt{DrawSegment()}
takes from 2-4 coordinates per vertex and returns the list that
represents the segments on the display list for refresh purposes.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf DrawSphere(w, x, y, z, r, ...) : record \hfill draw sphere}

\noindent
\texttt{DrawSphere(w, x, y, z, r,{\dots})} draws a sphere with radius
r centered at (x, y, z) on 3D window w. The display list element is
returned. This procedure fails if the context attribute \texttt{dim} is
set to 2.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf DrawString(w, x1, y1, s1, ...) : window \hfill draw text}

\noindent
\texttt{DrawString(w,x,y,s)} draws text \texttt{s} at coordinates (x,
y). This function does not draw any background; only the
characters' actual pixels are drawn. It is possible to
use \texttt{"drawop=reverse"} with this
function to draw erasable text. \texttt{DrawString()} does not affect
the text cursor position. Newlines present in \texttt{s} cause
subsequent characters to be drawn starting at (\texttt{x, current\_y +
leading}), where \texttt{x} is the \texttt{x} supplied to the function,
\texttt{current\_y} is the \texttt{y} coordinate the newline would have
been drawn on, and leading is the current leading associated with the
binding.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}

\noindent {\bf EraseArea(w, x:0, y:0, width:0, height:0. ...) : window \hfill
erase rectangular area}

\noindent
\texttt{EraseArea(w,x,y,width,height,...)} erases rectangular areas
within the window to the background color. If \texttt{width} is 0,
the region cleared extends from \texttt{x} to the right side of the
window. If \texttt{height} is 0, the region erased extends from
\texttt{y} to the bottom of the window. In 3D, \texttt{EraseArea(W)}
clears the contents of the entire window.

\noindent
{\bf Event(w, i:infinity) : string{\textbar}integer \hfill
 read event on window}

\noindent
\texttt{Event(w, i)} retrieves the next event available for window
\texttt{w}. If no events are available, \texttt{Event()} waits for
\texttt{i} milliseconds. Keystrokes are encoded as strings, while mouse
events are encoded as integers. The retrieval of an event is
accompanied by assignments to the keywords \texttt{\&x}, \texttt{\&y},
\texttt{\&row}, \texttt{\&col}, \texttt{\&interval},
\texttt{\&control}, \texttt{\&shift}, \texttt{\&meta}, and if 3D
attribute \texttt{{\textquotedblleft}pick=on{\textquotedblright}},
\texttt{\&pick}. \texttt{Event()} fails if the timeout expires before
an event occurs.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Fg(w, s) : string \hfill foreground color}

\noindent
\texttt{Fg(w)} retrieves the current foreground color. \texttt{Fg(w,s)}
sets the foreground by name or value. \texttt{Fg()} fails if the
foreground cannot be set to the requested color. In 3D, \texttt{Fg(w,
s)} changes the material properties of subsequently drawn objects to
the material properties specified by \texttt{s}. The string \texttt{s}
must be one or more semi-colon separated material properties. A
material property is of the form 

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [diffuse {\textbar} ambient {\textbar} specular
{\textbar} emission] \textit{color name} or
{\textquotedblleft}shininess n{\textquotedblright}, 0 {\textless}= n
{\textless}= 128.

If string \texttt{s} is omitted, the current values of the material

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Font(w, s) : string \hfill font}

\noindent
\texttt{Font(w)} produces the name of the current font.
\texttt{Font(w,s)} sets the window context's font to
\texttt{s} and produces its name or fails if the font name is invalid.
\ The valid font names are largely system-dependent but follow the
format \texttt{family[,styles],size}, where styles optionally add bold
or italic or both. Four font names are portable: \texttt{serif} (Times
or similar), \texttt{sans} (Helvetica or similar), \texttt{mono} (a
mono spaced sans serif font) and \texttt{typewriter} (Courier or
similar). \texttt{Font()} fails if the requested font name does not

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf FreeColor(w, s, ...) : window \hfill release colors}

\noindent
\texttt{FreeColor(w,s1,...,sn)} allows the window system to re-use the

dependent upon the particular implementation. If a freed color is
still in use at the time it is freed, unpredictable results will occur.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf GotoRC(w, row:1, col:1) : window \hfill go to row,column}

\noindent
\texttt{GotoRC(w,row,col)} moves the text cursor to a particular row and
column, given in numbers of characters; the upper-left corner is
coordinate (1,1). The column calculation used by \texttt{GotoRC()}
assigns to each column the pixel width of the widest character in the
current font. If the current font is of fixed width, this yields the
usual interpretation.

\texttt{Pattern(w,s)} selects stipple pattern \texttt{s} for use during
draw and fill operations. \texttt{s} may be either the name of a
system-dependent pattern or a literal of the form
\textit{width},\textit{bits}. Patterns are only used when the
\texttt{fillstyle} attribute is \texttt{stippled} or
\texttt{opaquestippled}. \texttt{Pattern()} fails if a named pattern

\noindent {\bf Pending(w, x, ...) : L \hfill produce event queue}

\noindent
\texttt{Pending(w)} produces the list of events waiting to be read from
window \texttt{w}. If no events are available, the list is empty (its
size is 0). \texttt{Pending(w,x1,...,xn)} adds \texttt{x1} through
\texttt{xn} to the end of \texttt{w}'s pending list in
guaranteed consecutive order.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Pixel(w, x:0, y:0, width:0, height:0) : i1...in \hfill

\noindent
\texttt{Pixel(w,x,y,width,height)} generates pixel contents from a
rectangular area within window \texttt{w}. \texttt{width * height}
results are generated starting from the upper-left corner and advancing
down to the bottom of each column before the next one is visited.
\ Pixels are returned in integer values; ordinary colors are encoded
nonnegative integers, while mutable colors are negative integers that
were previously returned by \texttt{NewColor()}. Ordinary colors are
encoded with the most significant eight bits all zero, the next eight
bits contain the red component, the next eight bits the green

matrix on the matrix stack. The display list element is returned. 

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf PushMatrix(w) : record \hfill push the matrix stack}

\noindent
\texttt{PushMatrix(w)} pushes a copy of the current matrix onto the

coordinates of the mouse relative to window \texttt{w}. If \texttt{w}
is omitted, \texttt{QueryPointer()} generates the coordinates relative
to the upper-left corner of the entire screen.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Raise(w) : window \hfill raise window}

\noindent
\texttt{Raise(w)} moves window \texttt{w} to the top of the window
stack, making it entirely visible and possibly obscuring other windows.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf ReadImage(w, s, x:0, y:0) : integer \hfill load image file}

\noindent
\texttt{ReadImage(w,s,x,y)} loads an image from the file named by s into
window w at offset \texttt{x,y}. \texttt{\ x} and \texttt{y} are
optional and default to 0,0. GIF, JPG, and BMP formats are supported,
along with platform-specific formats. If \texttt{ReadImage()} reads the
image into \texttt{w}, it returns either an integer 0 indicating no
errors occurred or a nonzero integer indicating that one or more colors
required by the image could not be obtained from the window system.
\ \texttt{ReadImage()} fails if file \texttt{s} cannot be opened for
reading or is an invalid file format.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Refresh(w) : window \hfill redraw the window}

\noindent
\texttt{Refresh(w) }redraws the contents of window \texttt{w}. It is
used mainly when objects have been moved in a 3D scene. The window
\texttt{w} is returned. 

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Rotate(w, a, x, y, z) : record \hfill rotate objects}

\noindent
\texttt{Rotate(w, a, x, y, z,{\dots})} rotates subsequent objects drawn
on 3D window \texttt{w} by angle \texttt{a} degrees, in the direction
(\texttt{x,y,z}). The display list element is returned.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Scale(w, x, y, z) : record \hfill\ scale
objects}

\noindent
\texttt{Scale(w, x, y, z,{\dots})} scales subsequent objects drawn on 3D
window \texttt{w} according to the given coordinates. The display list
element is returned.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf Texcoord(w, x, y, ...) : list \hfill define texture coordinates}

\noindent
\texttt{Texcoord(W, x}\texttt{\textsubscript{1}}\texttt{,
y}\texttt{\textsubscript{1}}\texttt{, {\dots},
x}\texttt{\textsubscript{n}}\texttt{,
y}\texttt{\textsubscript{n}}\texttt{) }sets the texture coordinates to
\texttt{x}\texttt{\textsubscript{1}}\texttt{,
y}\texttt{\textsubscript{1}}\texttt{, {\dots},
x}\texttt{\textsubscript{n}}\texttt{, y}\texttt{\textsubscript{n}} in
3D window w. Each x, y, pair forms one texture coordinate.
\texttt{Texcoord(W, L)} sets the texture coordinates to those specified
in the list \texttt{L}. \texttt{Texcoord(W, s) }sets the texture
coordinates to those specified by \texttt{s}. The string \texttt{s}
must be \texttt{{\textquotedblleft}auto{\textquotedblright}} otherwise
the procedure will fail. In all cases the display list element is
returned.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf TextWidth(w, s) : integer \hfill pixel width of text}

\noindent
\texttt{TextWidth(w,s)} computes the pixel width of string \texttt{s} in
the font currently defined for window \texttt{w}.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Texture(w, s) : record \hfill apply texture}

\noindent
\texttt{Texture(w, s) }specifies a texture image that is applied to
subsequent objects drawn on 3D window \texttt{w}. The string \texttt{s}
specifies the texture image as a filename, a string of the form
\texttt{width,pallet,data} or \texttt{width,\#,data}, where pallet is a
pallet from the Unicon 2D graphics facilities and data is the
hexadecimal representation of an image. \texttt{Texture(w1, w2)
}specifies that the contents of 2D or 3D window \texttt{w2} be used as
a texture image that is applied to subsequent objects on the window
\texttt{w1}. The display list element is returned.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf Translate(w, x, y, z, ...) : record \hfill translate object positions}

\noindent
\texttt{Translate(w, x, y, z,{\dots})} moves objects drawn subsequently
on 3D window w in the direction (\texttt{x,y,z}). The display list
element is returned.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf Uncouple(w) : window \hfill release binding}

\noindent
\texttt{Uncouple(w)} releases the binding associated with file
\texttt{w}. \texttt{Uncouple()} closes the window only if all other
bindings associated with that window are also closed.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf WAttrib(w, s1, ...) : x, ... \hfill generate or set attributes}

\noindent
\texttt{WAttrib(w, s1, ...)} retrieves and/or sets window and context
attributes. If called with exactly one attribute, integers are produced
for integer-value attributes; all other values are represented by
strings. If called with more than one attribute argument,
\texttt{WAttrib()} produces one string result per argument, prefixing
each value by the attribute name and an equals sign (=). If
\texttt{xi} is a window, subsequent attributes apply to \texttt{xi}.
\ \texttt{WAttrib()} fails if an attempt is made to set the attribute
\texttt{font}, \texttt{fg}, \texttt{bg}, or \texttt{pattern} to a value
that is not supported. A run-time error occurs for an invalid attribute
name or invalid value.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf WDefault(w, program, option) : string \hfill query user preference}

\noindent
\texttt{WDefault(w,program,option)} returns the value of option for
program as registered with the X resource manager. In typical use this
supplies the program with a default value for window attribute option
from a program.option entry in an .XDefaults file.
\ \texttt{WDefault()} fails if no user preference for the specified
option is available.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf WFlush(w) : window \hfill flush window output}

\noindent
\texttt{WFlush(w)} flushes window output on window systems that buffer
text and graphics output. Window output is automatically flushed
whenever the program blocks on window input. When this behavior is
not adequate, a call to \texttt{WFlush()} sends all window output
immediately, but does not wait for all commands to be received and
acted upon. \texttt{WFlush()} is a no-op on window systems that do not
buffer output.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf WindowContents(w) : list \hfill window display list}

\noindent
\texttt{WindowContents(w)} returns a list of display elements, which are
records or lists. Each element has a function name followed by the
parameters of the function, or an attribute followed by its value.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent
{\bf WriteImage(w, s, x:0, y:0, width:0, height:0) : window
\hfill save image file}

\noindent
\texttt{WriteImage(w,s,x,y,width,height)} saves an image of dimensions
width, height from window w at offset \texttt{x,y} to a file named
\texttt{s}. The default is to write the entire window. The file
is written according to the filename extension, in either GIF, JPG,
BMP, PNG, or a platform specific format such as XBM or XPM.
\ \texttt{WriteImage()} fails if \texttt{s} cannot be opened for
writing.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf WSection(w, s) : record \hfill define window section}

\noindent
\texttt{WSection(w,s)} starts a new window section named \texttt{s} on
3D window \texttt{w} and returns a display list section marker record.
During window refreshes if the section marker's
\texttt{skip} field is 1, the section is skipped. The section name
\texttt{s} is produced by \texttt{\&pick} if a primitive in the block
is clicked on while attribute
\texttt{{\textquotedblleft}pick=on{\textquotedblright}}.
\texttt{WSection(w)} marks the end of a preceding section.
\texttt{WSection()} blocks may be nested.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf WSync(w, s) : w \hfill synchronize with window system server}

\noindent
\texttt{WSync(w,s)} synchronizes the program with the server attached to
window \texttt{w} on those window systems that employ a client-server
model. Output to the window is flushed, and \texttt{WSync()} waits
for a reply from the server indicating all output has been processed.
\ If \texttt{s} is \texttt{"yes"}, all
events pending on \texttt{w} are discarded. \texttt{WSync()} is a no-op
on window systems that do not use a client-server model.

\section{Preprocessor}

Unicon features a simple \index{preprocessor}preprocessor that supports file
inclusion and symbolic constants. It is a subset of the capabilities found in
the C preprocessor, and is used primarily to support platform-specific code
sections and large collections of symbols.

\subsection{Preprocessor commands}

Preprocessor directives are lines beginning with a dollar sign. The
available preprocessor commands are:

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \$define symbol text \hfill symbolic substitution}

\noindent
\index{define symbols}All subsequent occurrences of \textit{symbol} are
replaced by the \textit{text} within the current file. Note that
\$define does not support arguments, unlike C.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \$include filename \hfill insert source file}

\noindent
\index{include}The named file is inserted into the compilation in place
of the \$include line.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \$ifdef symbol \hfill conditional compilation}

\noindent\index{ifdef symbol}{\textbf{\$ifndef}
\textit{symbol} \hfill conditional compilation}
\linebreak
{\textbf{\$else} \hfill conditional alternative}
\linebreak
{\textbf{\$endif} \hfill end of conditional code}

The subsequent lines of code, up to an \$else or \$endif, are discarded
unless \textit{symbol} is defined by some \$define directive. \$ifndef
reverses this logic.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \$error text \hfill compile error}

\noindent
\index{compile}The \index{compiler}compiler will emit an error with the
supplied text as a message.


\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\textbf{\$line} \textit{number}
[\textit{filename}] \hfill source code line}
\index{source code \$line}
{\textbf{\#line} \textit{number}
[\textit{filename}] \hfill source code line}

\noindent
The subsequent lines of code are treated by the compiler as commencing
from line \textit{number} in the file \textit{filename} or the current
file if no filename is given.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf \$undef symbol \hfill remove symbol definition}

\noindent
\index{undef}Subsequent occurrences of \textit{symbol} are no longer
replaced by any substitute text.

\bigskip\hrule\vspace{0.1cm}
\noindent {\bf EBCDIC transliterations \hfill alternative bracket characters}

\noindent
These character combinations were introduced for legacy keyboards that
were missing certain bracket characters.

\iconcode{
{\textbf \$ for \ \{ } \\
{\textbf \$) for \} } \\
{\textbf \${\textless}\ for $[$ } \\
{\textbf \${\textgreater} for $]$ }
}

These character combinations are substitutes for curly and square
brackets on keyboards that do not have these characters.

\subsection{Predefined symbols}

\index{predefined symbols}Predefined symbols are provided for each
platform and each feature that is optionally compiled in on some
platforms. These symbols include:

\section{Execution Errors}

There are two kinds of errors that can occur during the execution of an
Icon program: runtime errors and system errors. Runtime errors occur
when a semantic or logic error in a program results in a computation
that cannot perform as instructed. System errors occur when an
operating system call \index{fail!system call}fails to perform a
required service.

\subsection{Runtime errors}

By default, a \index{runtime error}runtime error causes program
execution to abort. Runtime errors are reported by name as well as by
number. They are accompanied by an error traceback that shows the
procedure call stack and value that caused the error, if there is one.
The errors are listed below to illustrate the kinds of situations that
can cause execution to terminate.

The keyword \texttt{\&error} turns runtime errors into
expression failure. When an expression fails due to a converted runtime
error, the keywords \texttt{\&errornumber}, \texttt{\&errortext}, and
\texttt{\&errorvalue} provide information about the nature of the error.

\subsection{System errors}

If an error occurs during the execution of a \index{error!system}system
function, by default the function fails and keywords \&errornumber, \&errortext
and \&errorvalue will be set. This contrasts with runtime errors, which
terminate execution by default. Whereas runtime errors can be converted to
failure by setting \&error, system errors can be converted to a runtime error by
setting keyword \&syserr to a non-null value.

The complete set of \index{system error}system errors is by definition platform
specific. Error numbers above the value 1000 are used for system errors. Many of
the POSIX standard system errors are supported across platforms, and error
numbers between 1001 and 1040 are reserved for the system errors listed
below. Platforms may report other system error codes so long as they do not
conflict with existing runtime or system error codes.

1001 \ \ \ \ \ Operation not permitted\\
1002 \ \ \ \ \ No such file or directory\\
1003 \ \ \ \ \ No such process\\
