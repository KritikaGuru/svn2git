\chapter{Adding Functions and Data Types}

Icon is designed so that new functions and data types can be added
with comparative ease. Such additions require changes only to the
run-time system; the translator and linker are not affected.

This appendix provides some guidelines for modifying the Icon run-time
system and lists useful macro definitions and support routines. It is
designed to be read in conjunction with the source code for the
implementation. The material included here only touches on the
possibilities. There is no substitute for actually implementing new
features and spending time studying the more intricate parts of the
Icon system.

{\color{red}
This appendix (which originally described version 6 of Icon) is a ``work in
progress'': The \textfn{iconx} directory was removed in Icon version 9 and
the files have migrated elsewhere (usually into \textfn{runtime}). The
macros and routines below that are highlighted in red no longer exist and,
in most cases, have been replaced by alternatives.  }

\section[D.1 File Organization]{D.1 File Organization}

The Icon system is organized in a hierarchy. Under UNIX, the root of
the Icon hierarchy is called icon.git/trunk {\color{blue} (the Unicon
root directory is called unicon)} and may be located anywhere.
Neither Icon nor Unicon depends on the name of the root directory and,
for other operating systems, it may be named differently.

The {\it root} directory has several subdirectories that contain
source code, test programs, documents, and so forth. The source code
is in {\it root}/src.  The subdirectories of src are shown below.

The subdirectory h holds header files that are included by files in the
other subdirectories. The file \textfn{h/rt.h} is particularly important,
since it contains most of the definitions and declarations used in the
run-time system.

The rest of the code related to the run-time system is in the subdirectory
\textfn{runtime}. first letters of files in this subdirectory indicate the
nature of their contents. Files that begin with the letter f contain code
for functions, while files that begin with o contain code for
operators. Code related directly to the interpretive process is in files
that begin with the letter i. {\textquotedbl}Library{\textquotedbl}
routines for operations such as list construction that correspond to
virtual machine instructions are in files that begin with the letter
l. Finally, files that begin with the letter r hold run-time support
routines.

Within each category, routines are grouped by functionality. For
example, string construction functions such as map are in \textfn{fstr.c},
while storage allocation and garbage collection routines are in
\textfn{rmemmgt.c}.

A simplified file structure is shown below. The emphasis is on
directories that contain source or documentation. Directories that are
common to both Icon and Unicon are in black; Icon specific directories are
shown in grey; Unicon specific directories are shown in blue.
In some cases there is additional sub-structure not shown here.

\section[D.2 Adding Functions]{D.2 Adding Functions}

There are several conventions and rules of protocol that must be followed
in writing a new function. The situations that arise most frequently are
covered in the following sections. The existing functions in f files in
\textfn{runtime} provide many examples to supplement the information given
here.

\subsection[D.2.1 Function Declarations]{D.2.1 Function Declarations}

A function begins with a call of the macro \texttt{\color{red}FncDcl(name, n)}, where
name is the name of the function as it is called in a source-language
program, and \texttt{n} is the number of arguments for the function. For
example,
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcl(map,3)}
\iconline{ \color{red}FncDcl(map,3) }
\noindent
appears at the beginning of the function map. This macro declares the
procedure block for the function and provides the beginning of the
declaration of a C function for the code that follows. The value of
\texttt{n} appears in the procedure block and is used to assure that the
number of arguments on the interpreter stack when the function is called is
the same as the number of arguments that the function expects. See
Sec. 10.3.

An \texttt{X} is prepended to the name given to avoid a collision with the
names of other C routines in the run-time system.  Thus, the C function
that implements map is named \texttt{Xmap}. Although the Icon function map
has three arguments, the corresponding C function has only one:
\texttt{cargp}, which is a pointer to an array of descriptors on the
interpreter stack.  For example, \texttt{\color{red}FncDcl(map, 3)} generates
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ Xmap(cargp)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ register struct descrip *cargp;}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\ \ Xmap(cargp)\\
\ \ register struct descrip *cargp;
\end{iconcode}
\noindent
Other macros are provided for referencing the descriptors: \texttt{Arg0} is
the descriptor into which the result of a function is placed before it
returns, \texttt{Arg1} is the first descriptor argument in the call of the
function, \texttt{Arg2} is the second descriptor argument, and so on. These
macros conceptually refer to the arguments in a source-language call of the
function. It is never necessary (or desirable) to refer to \texttt{cargp}
directly.

Note that the descriptor at \texttt{Arg0} initially points to the procedure
block for the function (see Sec. 10.1). It is fair to assume that
\texttt{Arg1}, \texttt{Arg2}, ..., \texttt{Argi}, where \texttt{i}
arguments are specified in the declaration contain valid descriptors.
Nothing can be assumed about the nature of these descriptors, other than
that they represent valid source-language values. Similarly, a function
must place a valid descriptor in \texttt{Arg0} before returning,
overwriting the procedure descriptor.

The macros described previously allow functions to be written without
worrying about the details of the interpreter stack. It is not
important to know how these macros are actually defined; it is best to
think of them in terms of the higher-level concepts they embody.

\subsection[D.2.2 Returning from a Function]{D.2.2 Returning from a Function}

A function returns control to the interpreter by use of one of three macros,
\texttt{Return}, \texttt{Suspend}, or \texttt{Fail}, depending on whether the
function returns, suspends, or fails, respectively. \texttt{Return} and
\texttt{Fail} return codes that the interpreter uses to differentiate between
the two situations. \texttt{Suspend} returns control to the interpreter by
calling it, as described in Sec. 9.3.

The use of \texttt{Return} is illustrated by the following trivial function
that simply returns its argument:
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcl(idem, 1)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Arg0 = Arg1;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Return;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \}}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\color{red}FncDcl(idem, 1)\\
\{\\
\>Arg0 = Arg1;\\
\>Return;\\
\}
\end{iconcode}
\noindent
For example,
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ write(idem({\textquotedbl}hello{\textquotedbl}))}
\iconline{ \ \ write(idem("hello")) }
\noindent writes \texttt{hello}.

The use of \texttt{Suspend} and \texttt{Fail} is illustrated by the following function,
which generates its first and second arguments in succession:
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcl(gen2,2)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Arg0 = Arg1;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Suspend;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Arg0 = Arg2;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Suspend;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Fail;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \}}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\color{red}FncDcl(gen2,2)\\
\{\\
\>Arg0 = Arg1;\\
\>Suspend;\\
\>Arg0 = Arg2;\\
\>Suspend;\\
\>Fail;\\
\}
\end{iconcode}
\noindent
For example,
%-% \ \ every write(gen2({\textquotedbl}hello{\textquotedbl}, {\textquotedbl}there{\textquotedbl}))
\iconline{every write(gen2("hello", "there"))}
\noindent
writes
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ hello}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ there}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\ \ hello\\
\ \ there
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
As illustrated previously, \texttt{Fail} is used when there is not another
result to produce. It is safe to assume that \texttt{Arg0}, \texttt{Arg1},
\ldots are intact when the function is resumed to produce another result.

Most functions have a fixed number of arguments. Only \texttt{write}, \texttt{writes},
and \texttt{stop} in the standard Icon repertoire can be called with an
arbitrary number of arguments. For a function that can be called with
an arbitrary number of arguments, an alternative declaration macro,
\texttt{FncDcIV(name)}, is used. When this macro is used, the function is
called with two arguments: the number of arguments in the call and a
pointer to the corresponding array of descriptors. For example,
\texttt{FncDcIV(write)} generates

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Xwrite(nargs, cargp)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% int nargs;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% register struct descrip cargp;}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
Xwrite(nargs, cargp)\\
int nargs;\\
register struct descrip cargp;
\end{iconcode}

Within such a function, \texttt{Arg0} refers to the return value as usual, but
the arguments are referenced using the macro \texttt{Arg(n}). For example, a
function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments and suspends with
them as values in succession is

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcIV(gen)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% register int n;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% for (n = 1; n {\textless}= nargs; n++) \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Arg0 = Arg(n);}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Suspend;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \}}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Fail;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
FncDcIV(gen)\\
\{\\
\>register int n;\\
\>for (n = 1; n <= nargs; n++) \{\\
\>\>Arg0 = Arg(n);\\
\>\>Suspend;\\
\>\}\\
\>Fail;\\
\}
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
For example,
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ every
%-% write(gen({\textquotedbl}hello{\textquotedbl},{\textquotedbl}there{\textquotedbl},{\textquotedbl}!{\textquotedbl}))}
\iconline{
\ \ every write(gen("hello","there","!"))
}

\noindent
writes

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ hello}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ there}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ !}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\ \ hello\\
\ \ there\\
\ \ !
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
Note the use of \texttt{Fail} at the end of the function; the omission of
\texttt{Fail} would be an error, since returning by flowing off the end of the
function would not provide the return code that the interpreter expects.

\subsection[D.2.3 Type Checking and Conversion]{D.2.3 Type Checking and Conversion}

Some functions need to perform different operations, depending on the
types of their arguments. An example is \texttt{type(x)}:

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ FncDcl(type, 1)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ if (Qual(Arg1)) (}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLen(Arg0) = 6;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLoc(Arg0) = {\textquotedbl}string{\textquotedbl};}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \}}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% else \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ switch (Type(Arg1)) (}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% case T\_Null:}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLen(Arg0) = 4;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLoc(Arg0) = {\textquotedbl}null{\textquotedbl};}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ break;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% case T\_Integer:}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% case T\_Long:}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLen(Arg0) = 7;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLoc(Arg0) = {\textquotedbl}integer{\textquotedbl};}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% break;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% case T\_Real:}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLen(Arg0) = 4;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLoc(Arg0) = {\textquotedbl}real{\textquotedbl};}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% break;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \}}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \}}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ Return;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \}}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\color{red}FncDcl(type, 1)\\
\{\\
\>if (Qual(Arg1)) \{\\
\>\>StrLen(Arg0) = 6;\\
\>\>StrLoc(Arg0) = "string";\\
\>\}\\
\>else \{\\
\>\>switch (Type(Arg1)) \{\\
\>\>\>case T\_Null:\\
\>\>\>\>StrLen(Arg0) = 4;\\
\>\>\>\>StrLoc(Arg0) = "null";\\
\>\>\>\>break;\\
\\
\>\>\>case T\_Integer:\\
\>\>\>case T\_Long:\\
\>\>\>\>StrLen(Arg0) = 7;\\
\>\>\>\>StrLoc(Arg0) = "integer";\\
\>\>\>\>break;\\
\\
\>\>\>case T\_Real:\\
\>\>\>\>StrLen(Arg0) = 4;\\
\>\>\>\>StrLoc(Arg0) = "real";\\
\>\>\>\>break;\\
\>\>\>\>\vdots\\
\>\>\>\}\\
\>\>\}\\
\>\>Return;\\
\>\}
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
As indicated by this function, the d-word serves to differentiate
between types, except for strings, which require a separate test.

For most functions, arguments must be of a specific type. As described in
Sec. 12.1, type conversion routines are used for this purpose. For example,
the function \texttt{tab(i)} requires that \texttt{i} be an integer. It
begins as follows:

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcl(tab, 1 )}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% register word i, j;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% word t, oldpos;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% long 11;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ /*}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ * Arg1 must be an integer.}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ */}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% if (cvint(\&Arg1, \&11) == CvtFail)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% runerr(101, \&Arg1);}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\color{red}FncDcl(tab, 1 )\\
\{\\
\>register word i, j;\\
\>word t, oldpos;\\
\>long I1;\\
\>\ \ /*\\
\>\ \ * Arg1 must be an integer.\\
\>\ \ */\\
\>if (cvint(\&Arg1, \&11) == CvtFail)\\
\>runerr(101, \&Arg1);
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
Note that \texttt{cvint} is called with the addresses of \texttt{Arg1} and
\texttt{I1}. If the conversion is successful, the resulting integer is assigned
to \texttt{I1}. As indicated by this example, it is the responsibility of a
function to terminate execution by calling \texttt{runerr} if a required
conversion cannot be made.

The routine \texttt{cvstr}, which converts values to strings, requires a buffer,
which is supplied by the routine that calls it.  See Sec. 4.4.4. This buffer
must be large enough to hold the longest string that can be produced by the
conversion of any value. This size is given by the defined constant
\texttt{MaxCvtLen}. For example, the function to reverse a string begins as
follows:

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcl(reverse.1 )}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% register char c. *floc. *lIoc;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% register word slen;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% char sbuf[MaxCvtLen];}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% extern char *alcstrO;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% /*}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% * Make sure that Arg1 is a string.}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% */}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% if (cvstr(\&Arg1. sbuf) == CvtFail)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% runerr(103. \&Arg1);}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\color{red}FncDcl(reverse,1)\\
\{\\
\>register char c. *floc. *lloc;\\
\>register word slen;\\
\>char sbuf[MaxCvtLen];\\
\>extern char *alcstr();\\
\>/*\\
\>\ * Make sure that Arg1 is a string.\\
\>\ */\\
\>if (cvstr(\&Arg1. sbuf) == CvtFail)\\
\>\>runerr(103. \&Arg1);
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
The buffer is used only if a nonstring value is converted to a string. In this
case, \texttt{Arg1} is changed to a qualifier whose v-word points to the
converted string in \texttt{sbuf}. This string does not necessarily begin at the
beginning of \texttt{sbuf}. In any event, after a successful call to
\texttt{cvstr}, the argument is an appropriate qualifier, regardless of whether
a conversion actually was performed.

\subsection[D.2.4 Constructing New Descriptors]{D.2.4 Constructing New Descriptors}

Some functions need to construct new descriptors to return in \texttt{Arg0}.
Sometimes it is convenient to construct a descriptor by assignment to its d- and
v-words. Various macros are provided to simplify these assignments. As given in
the function \texttt{type} previously, \texttt{StrLen} and \texttt{StrLoc} can
be used to construct a qualifier. For example, to return a qualifier for the
string \texttt{"integer"}, the following code suffices:
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLen(Arg0) = 7;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLoc(Arg0) = {\textquotedbl}integer{\textquotedbl};}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Return;}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
StrLen(Arg0) = 7;\\
StrLoc(Arg0) = "integer";\\
Return;
\end{iconcode}
\noindent
Here, the returned qualifier points to a statically allocated C string.

There also are macros and support routines for constructing certain
kinds of descriptors. For example, the macro

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Mkint(i, dp);}
\iconline{\color{red} Mkint(i, dp); }

\noindent
constructs an integer descriptor containing the integer \texttt{i} in the
descriptor pointed to by \texttt{dp}. The definition of \texttt{\color{red}Mkint}
depends on the word size of the computer. On 32-bit computers,
\texttt{\color{red}Mkint} simply produces assignments to the d-word and v-word of
descriptor pointed to by \texttt{dp}. On computers with 16-bit words, which
have both \texttt{T\_Integer} and \texttt{T\_Long} forms of integers,
\texttt{\color{red}Mkint} produces a call to a support routine.

\subsection[D.2.5 Default Values]{D.2.5 Default Values}

Many functions specify default values for null-valued arguments. There
are support routines for providing default values. For example,

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% defstr(Arg3, sbuf, \&q);}
\iconline{ \color{red}defstr(Arg3, sbuf, \&q); }


\noindent
changes \texttt{Arg3} to the string given by the qualifier \texttt{q} in
case \texttt{Arg3} is null-valued. If \texttt{Arg3} is not null-valued,
however, its value is converted to a string, if possible, by
\texttt{\color{red}defstr}. If this is not possible, \texttt{\color{red}defstr} terminates
execution with an error message.

\subsection[D.2.6 Storage Allocation]{D.2.6 Storage Allocation}

Functions that construct new data objects often need to allocate
storage. Allocation is done in the allocated string region or the
allocated block region, depending on the nature of the object. Support
routines are provided to perform the actual allocation.

As mentioned in Sec. 11.4, predictive need requests \textit{must} be made
before storage is actually allocated. The functions \texttt{strreq(i)} and
\texttt{blkreq(i)} request \texttt{i} bytes of storage in the allocated
string and block regions, respectively.

Such a request generally should be made as soon as an upper bound on the
amount of storage needed is known. It is not necessary to know the exact
amount, but the amount requested must be at least as large as the amount
that actually will be allocated. For example, the function
\texttt{reads(f. i)} requests \texttt{i} bytes of string storage, although
the string actually read may be shorter.

\textbf{String Allocation}. The function \texttt{alcstr(s, i)} copies
\texttt{i} bytes starting at \texttt{s} into the allocated string region
and returns a pointer to the beginning of the copy. For example, a function
\texttt{double(s)} that produces the concatenation of \texttt{s} with
itself is written as follows:
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcl(double. 1)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% register int glen;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% char sbuf[MaxCvtLen];}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% extern char *alcstrO;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% if (cvstr(\&Arg1. sbuf) == NULL)}
%-%

%-% runerr(103, \&Arg1);}
%-%

%-% glen = StrLen(Arg1);}
%-%

%-% strreq(2 * glen);}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLen(Arg0) = 2 * glen;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% StrLoc(Arg0) = alcstr(StrLoc(Arg1). glen);}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% alcstr(StrLoc(Arg1), glen);}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% Return;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \}}
\goodbreak

\end{iconcode}

If the first argument of \texttt{alcstr} is \texttt{NULL}, instead of being
a pointer to a string, the space is allocated and a pointer to the
beginning of it is returned, but nothing is copied into the space. This
allows a function to construct a string directly in the allocated string
region.

If a string to be returned is in a buffer as a result of conversion
from another type, care must be taken to copy this string into the
allocated string region --- otherwise the string in the buffer will
be overwritten on subsequent calls. Copying such strings is
illustrated by the function \texttt{string(x)} given in Sec. 12.1.

\textbf{Block Allocation}. The routine \texttt{alcblk(i)} allocates
\texttt{i} bytes in the allocated block region and returns a pointer to the
beginning of the block. The argument of \texttt{alcblk} must correspond to
a whole number of words. There are run-time support routines for allocating
various kinds of blocks. These routines, in turn, call \texttt{alcblk}.
Such support routines generally fill in part of the block as well. For
example, \texttt{alccset(i)} allocates a block for a cset, fills in the
title and size words, and zeroes the bits for the cset:
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% struct b\_cset *alccset(size)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% int size;}

\subsection[D.2.7 Storage Management Considerations]%
           {D.2.7 Storage Management Considerations}

In addition to assuring that predictive need requests are made before
storage is allocated, it is essential to assure that all descriptors
contain valid data at any time a garbage collection may occur, that
all descriptors are accessible to the garbage collector, and that all
pointers to allocated data are in the v-words of descriptors.

Normally, all the descriptors that a function uses are on the interpreter
stack and are referenced as \texttt{Arg0}, \texttt{Arg1}, \ldots.  Such
descriptors are processed by the garbage collector. Occasionally,
additional descriptors are needed for intermediate computations. If such
descriptors contain pointers in their v-words, it is \textit{not} correct
to declare local descriptors, as in
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% FncDcl(mesh,2)}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% struct descrip d1, d2;}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
\color{red}FncDcl(mesh,2)\\
\{\\
\>struct descrip d1, d2;
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
The problem with this approach is that \texttt{d1} and \texttt{d2} are on
the C stack and the garbage collector has no way of knowing about them.

However, since all descriptors on the interpreter stack are accessible
to the garbage collector, intermediate computations can be performed
on descriptors on the interpreter stack. Extra descriptors for this
purpose can be provided by increasing the number of arguments
specified for the function. Thus,

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ FncDcl(mesh,4)}
\iconline{\color{red}FncDcl(mesh,4) }

\noindent
makes \texttt{Arg3} and \texttt{Arg4} available for intermediate
computations. The initial values of \texttt{Arg3} and \texttt{Arg4} will be
null because of argument adjustment performed by invoke unless mesh is
called with extra arguments.

Garbage collection can occur only during a predictive need
request. However, a predictive need request can occur between the time
a function suspends and the time it is resumed to produce another
result. Consequently, if a pointer is kept in a C variable in a loop
that is producing results by suspending, the pointer may be invalid
when the function is resumed. Instead, the pointer should be kept in
the v-word of a descriptor that is accessible to the garbage
collector.

\subsection[D.2.8 Error Termination]{D.2.8 Error Termination}

An Icon program may terminate abnormally for two reasons: as the
result of a source-language programming error (such as an invalid type
in a function call), or as a result of an error detected in the Icon
system itself (such as a descriptor that should have been dereferenced
but was not).

In case a source-language error is detected, execution is terminated
by a call of the form

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ runerr(i, \&d);}
\iconline{runerr(i, \&d); }

\noindent where \texttt{i} is an error message number and \texttt{d} is the
descriptor for the offending value. If there is no specific offending
value, the second argument is 0.

The array of error message numbers and corresponding messages is
contained in \textfn{runtime/data.r}. If there is no appropriate existing error
message, a new one can be added, following the guidelines given in
Appendix D of Griswold and Griswold 1983.

In theory, there should be no errors in the Icon system itself, but no
large, complex software system is totally free of errors. Some situations
are recognizable as being potential sources of problems in case data does
not have the expected values. In such situations, especially during program
development, it is advisable to insert calls of the function
\texttt{syserr}, which terminates execution, indicating that an error was
detected in the Icon system, and prints its argument as an indication of
the nature of the error. It is traditional to use calls of the form

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ syserr({\textquotedbl}mesh: can't happen{\textquotedbl});}
\iconline{syserr("mesh: can't happen"); }

\noindent so that when, in fact, the ``impossible'' does happen, there is a
reminder of human frailty.  More informative messages are desirable, of
course.

\subsection[D.2.9 Header Files]{D.2.9 Header Files}

If a new function is added to an existing f file in \textfn{runtime}, the
necessary header files normally will be included automatically. If a
new function is placed in a new file, that file should begin with

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \#include {\textquotedbl}../h/rt.h{\textquotedbl}}
\iconline{\#include "../h/rt.h" }

% The redefinition of arraystretch works as a way of reducing inter-row
% spacing in the table, but maybe we should find a more elegant solution.
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{0.9}%
\noindent
This header file includes ten other header files:\\[1ex]

\noindent\hspace{0.5cm}% Indent the entire table
% The magic spell ">{\textfn\bgroup} ... <{\egroup}" sets the font

}\\[1ex]
% arraystretch is now back to normal

\noindent
All of these files contain appropriate information for the local
installation, and no changes in them should be needed.


In rare cases, it may be necessary to include other header files.
% [DonW] gc.h does not exist anymore. After looking at the Icon V6.7 gc.h,
% most of the definitions have been absorbed into rmacros.h. If we can think of
% another example then I suggest we reinstate the next sentence with it.
%
%  For example, a function that deals directly with garbage collection might
%  need to include \textfn{iconx/gc.h}.

\subsection[D.2.10 Installing a New Function]{D.2.10 Installing a New Function}

Both the linker and the run-time system must know the names of all
functions. This information is provided in the header file \textfn{h/fdefs.h}.


In order to add a function, a line of the form
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ FncDef(name)}
\iconline{FncDef(name) }

\noindent must be inserted in h/fdefs.h in proper alphabetical order.

Once this insertion is made, the Icon system must be recompiled to
take into account the code for the new function. The steps involved in
recompilation vary from system to system. Information concerning
recompilation is available in system-specific installation documents.

\section[D.3 Adding Data Types]{D.3 Adding Data Types}

Adding a new data type is comparatively simple, although there are
several places where changes need to be made. Failure to make all the
required changes can produce mysterious bugs.

\subsection[D.3.1 Type Codes]{D.3.1 Type Codes}

At present, type codes range from 0 to 25 {\color{blue} (31 for
Unicon)}. Every type must have a distinct type code and corresponding
definitions.  These additions are made in \textfn{h/rmacros.h}. First, a
\texttt{T\_}definition is needed. For example, if a Boolean type is added,
a definition such as

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \#define T\ \ \_Boolean\ \ 19}
\iconline{\#define T\_Boolean\ \ \ 26 }

\noindent is needed. The value of \texttt{MaxType}, which immediately follows
the type code definitions, must be increased to 26 accordingly.
Failure to set \texttt{MaxType} to the maximum type code may result in
program malfunction during garbage collection. See Sec. 11.3.2.

Next a \texttt{D\_} definition is needed for the d-word of the new type.
For a Boolean type, this definition might be

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \ \ \#define D\_Boolean\ \ (T\_Boolean I F\_Nqual)}
\iconline{\#define D\_Boolean\ \ (T\_Boolean | F\_Nqual) }

\noindent
All nonstring types have the \texttt{F\_Nqual} flag and their \texttt{T\_}
type code. Types whose v-words contain pointers also have the
\texttt{F\_Ptr} flag.

\subsection[D.3.2 Structures]{D.3.2 Structures}

A value of a Boolean type such as the one suggested previously can be
stored in the d-word of its descriptor. However, most types contain
pointers to blocks in their v-words. In this case, a declaration of a
structure corresponding to the block must be added to \textfn{h/rstructs.h}.
For example, a new rational number data type, with the type code
\texttt{T\_Rational}, might be represented by a block containing two
descriptors, one for the numerator and one for the denominator. An
appropriate structure declaration for such a block is

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% struct b\_rational \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% int title;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% struct descrip numerator;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% struct descrip denominator;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \};}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
struct b\_rational \{\\
\>int title;\\
\>struct descrip numerator;\\
\>struct descrip denominator;\\
\};
\end{iconcode}

Since rational blocks are fixed in size, no size field is needed. However,
a vector type with code \texttt{T\_Vector} in which different vectors have
different lengths needs a size field. The declaration for such a block
might be

%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% struct b\_vector \{}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% int title;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% int blksize;}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% struct descrip velems[1];}
%-% 
%-% {\ttfamily\mdseries
%-% \};}
\goodbreak
\begin{iconcode}
struct b\_vector \{\\
\>int title;\\
\>int blksize;\\
\>struct descrip velems[1];\\
\};
\end{iconcode}

\noindent
As mentioned in Sec. 4.4.2, the size of one for the array of
descriptors is needed to avoid problems with C compilers.  In
practice, this structure conceptually overlays the allocated block
region, and the number of elements varies from block to block.

Any new structure declaration for a block must be added to the declaration
union \texttt{block} in \textfn{h/rstructs.h}. The order of the fields in a
new structure must follow the rules (discussed next) imposed by the garbage
collector.

\subsection[D.3.3 Information Needed for Storage Management]%
           {D.3.3 Information Needed for Storage Management}

In Icon version 8 and later, allocated data may be referred to in two ways:
either (as before) in the v-word of a descriptor, or in one of the pointers
in a structure.  All pointers to allocated data must be contained either in
the v-words of descriptors or in pointers, since this is the only way the
garbage collector can locate them. Furthermore, all non-descriptor data
(including pointers) must precede any descriptors in a block. The amount of
non-descriptor data, and hence the location of the first descriptor in a
block, must be the same for all blocks of a given type. Pointers add new
constraints: If any pointers are present, they must be in one contiguous
group and must precede the first descriptor in the block although they need
not be placed immediately before the descriptors.  If any block has a
variable number of pointers they must be placed at the end of the block
(and there can be no descriptors in the block).

As described in Sec. 11.3.2, the garbage collector uses the array
\texttt{bsizes} to determine the size of a block and the array
\texttt{firstd} to determine the offset of the first descriptor in the
block. These arrays are in \textfn{rmemmgt.r}. When a new data type is
added, appropriate entries must be made in these arrays. Failure to do so
may result in serious bugs that occur only in programs that perform garbage
collection, and the symptoms may be mysterious.

There is an entry in \texttt{bsizes} for each type code. If the type has no
block, the entry is -1. If the type has a block of constant size, the entry
is the size of the block. Otherwise, the entry is 0, indicating that the
size is in the second word of the block. Thus, the entry for
\texttt{T\_Boolean} would be -1, the entry for \texttt{T\_Rational} would
be \texttt{sizeof(struct b\_rational)}, and the size for \texttt{T\_Vector}
would be 0.

There is a corresponding entry in \texttt{firstd} for each type code that
gives the offset of the first descriptor in its corresponding block. If
there is no block, the entry is -1. If the block contains no descriptors,
the entry is 0. For example, the entry for \texttt{T\_Boolean} would be -1,
the entry for \texttt{T\_Rational} would be \texttt{WordSize}, and the
entry for \texttt{T\_Vector} would be \texttt{2*WordSize}, where
\texttt{WordSize} is a defined constant that is the number of bytes in a
word.

Two further arrays are used to determine the placement of pointers.
\texttt{firstp} is analogous to \texttt{firstd}: there is one entry per
type. If there is no block, the entry is -1. If the type has no pointers
the value is 0, otherwise it is the offset of the first pointer in the
block.  It is possible to infer the number of descriptors from the position
of the first and the size of the block, but this inference is not always
possible for pointers so an array \texttt{ptrno} is used to indicate how
many pointers there are for each type. If there are no pointers, the value
is -1. A value of 0 means that the pointers occupy the rest of the block
(and the block has no descriptors). Otherwise the entry contains the number
of pointers in the block. As with \texttt{firstd} and \texttt{bsizes}, a
failure to initialize \texttt{firstp} and \texttt{ptrno} correctly may
result in serious (and mysterious) bugs.

A fifth array, \texttt{blknames}, provides string names for all block
types. These names are only used for debugging, and an entry should be
made in \texttt{blknames} for each new data type.

\subsection[D.3.4 Changes to Existing Code]{D.3.4 Changes to Existing Code}

In addition to any functions that may be needed for operating on
values of a new data type, there are several functions and operators
that apply to all data types and which may, therefore, need to be
changed for any new data type.

\noindent
These are\\[1ex]
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{0.9}%
\begin{xtabular}{>{\hspace{1cm}\texttt\bgroup}l<{\egroup}@{\hspace{1cm}}p{11cm}}
 *x      & size of x (in \textfn{runtime/omisc.r)}\\
copy(x)  & copy of x (in \textfn{runtime/fmisc.r)}\\
image(x) & string image of x (in \textfn{runtime/fmisc.r)}\\
type(x)  & string name of type of x (in \textfn{runtime/fmisc.r)}\\
\end{xtabular}
}\\[1ex]

There is not a concept of size for all data types. For example, a
Boolean value presumably does not have a size, but the size of a
vector presumably is the number of elements it contains. The size of a
rational number is problematical.  Modifications to *x are easy; see
Sec. 4.4.4.

There must be some provision for copying any value. For structures,
such as vectors, physical copies should be made so that they are
treated consonantly with other Icon structures. For other data types,
the ``copy'' consists of simply returning
the value and not making a physically distinct copy.  This should be
done for data types, such as Boolean, for which there are only
descriptors and no associated blocks.  Whether or not a copy of a
block for a rational value should be made is a more difficult decision
and depends on how such values are treated conceptually, at the
source-language level. It is, of course, easiest not to make a
physical copy.

Some image must be provided for every value. This image should contain
enough information to distinguish values of different types and, where
possible, to provide some useful additional information about the
specific value. The amount of detail that it is practical to provide
in the image of a value is limited by the fact that the image is a
string that must be placed in the allocated string region.


The type must be provided for all values and should consist of a
simple string name. For example, if x is a Boolean value, type(x)
should produce {\textquotedbl}boolean{\textquotedbl}. The coding for
type is trivial; see Sec. D.2.3.

There also are several run-time support routines that must be modified
for any new type:\\[1ex]
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{0.9}%
\begin{xtabular}{>{\hspace{1cm}\texttt\bgroup}l<{\egroup}@{\hspace{1cm}}p{11cm}}
outimage & image for tracing (in \textfn{runtime/rmisc.r)}\\
order    & order for sorting (in \textfn{runtime/rcomp.r)}\\
anycmp   & comparison for sorting (in \textfn{runtime/rcomp.r)}\\
equiv    & equivalence comparison (in \textfn{runtime/rcomp.r)}\\
\end{xtabular}
}\\[1ex]

The image produced for tracing purposes is similar to that produced by
image and must be provided for all data types.  However, outimage
produces output and is not restricted to constructing a string in
allocated storage. It therefore can be more elaborate and informative.

There must be some concept of sorting order for every Icon
value. There are two aspects to sorting: the relative order of
different data types and the ordering among values of the same
type. The routine order produces an integer that corresponds to the
order of the type. If the order of a type is important with respect to
other types, this matter must be given some consideration. For
example, a rational number probably belongs among the numeric types,
which, in Icon, sort before structure types. On the other hand, it
probably is not important whether vectors come before or after lists.


The routine \texttt{anycmp} compares two values; if they have the same
order, as defined previously, \texttt{anycmp} determines which is the
``smaller.''  For example, Boolean ``false'' might (or might not) come
before ``true,'' but some ordering between the two should be provided.
On the other hand, order among vectors probably is not important (or
well-defined), and they can be lumped with the other structures in
\texttt{anycmp}, for which ordering is arbitrary. Sometimes ordering can be
quite complicated; a correct ordering of rational numbers is nontrivial.


The routine \texttt{equiv} is used in situations, such as table
subscripting and case expressions, to determine whether two values are
equivalent in the Icon sense. Generally speaking, two structure values are
considered to be equivalent if and only if they are identical. This
comparison is included in \texttt{equiv} in a general way. For example,
\texttt{equiv} need not be modified for vectors. Similarly, for data types
that have no corresponding blocks, descriptor comparison suffices;
\texttt{equiv} need not be modified for Boolean values either. However,
determining the equivalence of numeric values, such as rational numbers,
requires some thought.

Although not strictly part of the language proper, there are several
routines in the Icon Programming Library and the Unicon class libraries
that operate on all types. The addition of new type may require that some
of these be modified. A good start to locating code that potentially
requires modification is to search for expressions of the form
\iconline{case \ldots type( \ldots ) \ldots of}

\section[D.4 Defined Constants and Macros]{D.4 Defined Constants and Macros}

Defined constants and macros are used heavily in Icon to parameterize
its code for different operating systems and computer architectures
and to provide simple, high-level constructions for commonly occurring
code sequences that otherwise would be complex and obscure.

These defined constants and macros should be used consistently when
making additions to Icon instead of using \textit{ad hoc}
constructions. This improves portability, readability, and
consistency.

Learning the meanings and appropriate use of the existing defined
constants and macro definitions requires investment of time and
energy. Once learned, however, coding is faster, simpler, and less
prone to error.

\subsection[D.4.1 Defined Constants]{D.4.1 Defined Constants}

The following defined constants are used frequently in the run-time
system. This list is by no means exhaustive; for specialized
constants, see existing functions.\\[1ex]

\textfn{h/rt.h} for the others; see existing routines for examples of
usages.\\[0.5cm]

\section[D.5 Support Routines]{D.5 Support Routines}

There are many support routines for performing tasks that occur frequently in
the Icon run-time system. Most of these routines are in files in \textfn{runtime}
that begin with the letter r. The uses of many of these support routines have
been illustrated earlier; what follows is a catalog for reference.

\section[D.6 Debugging]{D.6 Debugging}

Debugging a modification to Icon can be difficult unless the overall structure of
the Icon system is understood. It is especially important to understand the way
Icon's data is organized and how storage management works. If an addition to
Icon does not work properly, or if Icon itself no longer functions correctly
after a modification, it is generally advisable to {\em think} about the
possible sources of problems, instead of immediately resorting to a debugger.

Print statements are a crude but often effective means of locating the source of
an error. When adding diagnostic output use
\iconline{fprintf(stderr, " \ldots ",\ \ldots );}
\noindent
instead of the corresponding \texttt{printf}. On some systems it may be useful
to follow such calls by \texttt{fflush(stderr)} to ensure that the diagnostoc
output appears as soon as it is produced.

Icon normally traps floating-point exception and illegal addressing
(segmentation violations) since these errors can result from source-language
progarmming errors, such as division by real zero and excessive recursion
resulting in C stack overflow. For example, Icon normally produces
\texttt{Error 302 ("C stack overflow")} in case of a segmentation violation.
This method of handling such an error is appropriate if Icon itself is free of
bugs, but it interferes with debugging in situations where there are likely to
be bugs in new code.

Assigning a value to the environment variable \texttt{ICONCORE} turns off the
trapping of such errors. In this case most systems produce meaningful diagnostic
messages and a core dump in the case of an exception.  If \texttt{ICONCORE} has
a value, a core dump is produced if an Icon program terminates as a result of
\texttt{runerr} or \texttt{syserr}.  It is therefore good practice to set
\texttt{ICONCORE} when making modifications to Icon. For an extended debugging
session, it may be convenient to set \texttt{dodump} in \textfn{runtime/init.r} to 1.
