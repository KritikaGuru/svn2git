Ui is a simple integrated development environment (IDE) for the
Unicon programming language. Ui makes it simple to edit, compile,
run, and debug Unicon programs.  Ui runs on any platform that supports
Unicon's 2D graphics facilities, including UNIX-based
and Windows platforms. Its source code provides various examples
of extending and customizing a graphical user interface generated
using the IVIB interface builder tool.

<h3><a name="intro">1. Introduction</a></h3>


This report describes a simple integrated development environment for
the Unicon programming language[1], called Ui. The goal
for Ui is to make it as simple as possible to edit, compile, and
execute Unicon programs.
By design and intention, Ui is much smaller and easier to learn
than industry behemoths such as Eclipse and Visual Studio.
<p>

Even Ui's very "simple" goals are complicated by the fact
that the tool needs to run on any machine where Unicon runs
with graphics facilities enabled. At this time, this primarily
consists of UNIX-based systems that run the X Window System, such
as Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and
Microsoft Windows-based machines.  There is a practical minimal
screen resolution limit, probably around 800x600 for this tool.

<p>

Ui is a product of the Unicon Project and is a standard part of the
Unicon programming language distribution, developed under the GPL, hosted on
Source Forge, and downloaded from http://unicon.org.
If you are not already familiar with Unicon you may wish to consult
other technical reports from that site, such as UTR #7[2], along with
this one.
Windows Unicon and the Ui environment are based on
the volunteer work of many people; final responsibility for this release
rests with Clinton Jeffery of University of Idaho.

<h3>2. Editing, Compiling, and Executing Programs</h3>

Double-click the Windows Unicon icon to launch <em>Ui</em>, the Unicon IDE
(integrated development environment).  <em>Ui</em> is written in Unicon and
allows you to edit, compile, and execute programs from a graphic user
interface. Ui is designed to run the same on UNIX and Linux as it does on
Windows. Ui's documentation (this file) may be accessed on-line through
its Help menu.
To start, you must select the name of a file to edit, in following dialog:
<p>

</p><center>
<img src="utr12/uiopen.png"> <br>
Figure 1: Opening a File within Ui
</center>
<p>

You can easily select an existing Unicon source file, or name a new one.
If you click "Open" without choosing a name, you will be given the default
name of "noname.icn".  Unicon source files generally must use the extension
<code>.icn</code> and should be plain text files without line numbers or
other extraneous information.  Editing your program occurs within the main
<em>Ui</em> window, which might look like this:
</p><p>

</p><center>
<img src="utr12/uiedit.png"> <br>

</center>
<p>

The top area shows program source code, while the bottom portion shows
messages such as compiler errors.  You can change the font and the number
of lines used to show messages from the Edit menu.
</p><p>
When you are done editing your program, you can save it, compile it, or
just "make" (save, compile and link an executable) and run your program
with menu options.  The Arguments command in the Run... menu let's you
specify any command-line arguments the program should be given when it
is executed.

</p>
<A name="findreplace"><h3> 3. Find/Replace </h3></A>

Ui's Find/Replace capabilities include a search text-field on the right side
of the tool-bar for quickly finding text, and an expanded dialog for
searching and replacing.

<p>
<table>
<tr><TD>
    <img src="utr12/findReplace3.png" width=400> <td>
<img src="utr12/findReplace2.png" width=400>
</table>

The search text-field is bracketed by two buttons: a find button on the far
right edge which initiates a search, and a direction toggle button to the left
of the search text-field that changes the direction of the search.
<p>

For more substantial search tasks,
the Find &amp; Replace dialog accessed from the Edit menu supports
case-insensitive, backwards, and regular expression searching.

</p>
<A name="errorhandling"><h3> 4. Error Handling </h3></A>

Compile errors result in a message in which the editor highlights
the line at which the error was detected, like this:

<p>

</p><center>
<img src="utr12/comperr.png"> <br>
Figure 3: Reporting Compiler Errors in Ui
</center>
<p>

Run-time errors also result in a message for which the source line is
highlighted.  The message for a run-time error includes Unicon's standard
traceback of procedures from <code>main()</code> to the procedure in which
the error occurred.  When the error messages get long, you can either
increase the number of lines for the message window (as was done here) or
scroll through the message window's entire text using the scrollbar.

<h3><a name="projects">5. Projects</a></h3>

Ui works on programs comprised of any number of source files.  By default,
Ui assumes a single file program consisting of the current source file.  If
you are working on a single-file program, and you open a new
<code>.icn</code> source file, Ui switches the editor and compile and
link commands to work on a different program.<p>

Project files are plain text files with extension <code>.icp</code>.  They
list source files, one file per line.  When you open a project file, Ui goes
into "project mode", and adds the source files in the project to your File
menu, allowing you to switch easily between files in the project.  If you
subsequently open a source file not in the project, Ui asks if you want to
add that source file to the project, or switch out of project mode and edit
that file as a separate program.  In general, project files allow you to
"make" large projects efficiently. Underneath the covers, Ui invokes the
other Unicon program executables to do the work of compiling and running
programs, described below.</p><p>

When Ui "makes" a program executable, it recompiles those modules listed in
the project file whose modified time is newer than their corresponding
object files.  On the other hand, Ui knows nothing about link declarations
embedded in source files, and recompilation will not be triggered by such
dependencies.  When you use Ui, you should generally use link statements for
library files (such as Unicon Program Library modules), and use
<code>.icp</code> files for your own sources. Files listed in the .icp file
must not also be referenced in a link statement; linking the same module
twice causes link errors.  For projects, the executable <code>.bat</code>
that is produced by "make" is named after the first program in the project
file.

</p>
<h3><A name="options">6. Ui Options </A></h3>

Ui supports command-line options to be passed to wicont
with the Compiler Options... menu item in the Compile menu.
Command-line arguments passed to the Unicon program when it is run are
supplied via the Arguments... menu item in the Run menu.<p>

The font in the edit window can be picked from the Font...
command in the Edit menu.  The number of lines to use for
messages can be picked with the Message window... menu item
in the Edit menu.</p><p>

The font and message line options, as well as a default window width and
height, may be specified in a file called <code>ui.ini</code>
that Ui reads when it starts up.  The file <code>ui.ini</code>
from the current directory is used, unless a UNICONINI environment
variable is set, in which case it is taken to be the pathname of
the initialization file that Ui is to use.  An example <code>ui.ini</code>
file is the following:

</p><pre>width=800
height=800
font=times,28
msglines=3
</pre>

<h3><a name="history">7. History and Related Work</a></h3>

<blockquote>
Many Bothan spies died to bring us this information. -- Mon Mothma
</blockquote

Integrated development environments were pioneered at Xerox for Lisp and
SmallTalk, and popularized on PC's by Borland.  This section will not
recite these important seminal contributions, but instead limit its
scope to the long history of related work on integrated development environments
for Icon and Unicon.
<p>

In the early 1990's, a prominent member of the Icon community (Bob Goldberg,
if I recall correctly) did a very rough prototype IDE for Icon on Windows,
which whetted our appetite for this category of tool. An M.S. student at
UTSA, Steve Schiavo, did a second prototype IDE in Borland Delphi.  These
efforts featured basic editing, compiling, and executing but were not
feature complete and never released.
<p>

Clint Jeffery ported Icon's graphics facilities to Windows while at UTSA,
as part of his agreed contribution for the book "Graphics Programming in
Icon"[3]. An IDE (along with a setup.exe installer) was considered essential
for the Windows Icon distribution. In order to minimize external language-
and compiler-dependencies, and in order to test and demonstrate the
functionality of Windows Icon, Schiavo's IDE was reimplemented in Icon
by Clint Jeffery as a program called Wi (Windows icon).
In order to provide an attractive, native-looking GUI, Windows95 native
dialogs (the Win* functions) were added to the language specifically for
use in Wi. The Wi program was modified slightly to form
Wu (Windows unicon) when that language was invented.
<p>

Although the Wu program was nice, it was limited to only run on Windows,
and made extensive use of Windows-only native GUI functions. Even on
Windows it had some nasty limitations, such as a 32kb file size limit
imposed by the classic native windows text editor widget. After Robert
Parlett contributed his wonderful GUI class library, which supported fonts
and colors, it became ever more desirable to build a Unicon IDE that would
run on all Unicon platforms.  There were multiple failed attempts, such as
Bryan Ross's RUDE (Ross' Unicon Development Environment).
<p>

Finally, the Ui program was developed by Clint Jeffery, using Parlett's
IVIB interface builder and adapting code from Wu. Unfortunately, various
elements of Wu were not replicated immediately in Ui, and it has only
gradually progressed towards a complete or usable feature set.  Its toolbar was
added by Nolan Clayton. Syntax coloring was added by Luis Alvidrez.
Hani bani Salameh ported it to version 2 of the GUI classes. It is by now
the work of several people, and remains very small and lacks features compared
with mainstream IDE's.  However, it continues to evolve.


<h3><a name="conclusions">8. Conclusions and Future Work</a></h3>

The Ui program is a relatively small multi-platform IDE for Unicon.
Its original author (Jeffery) is perpetually
embarrassed by its lack of features, and is grateful for the help he
has received towards making Ui less of a toy.
Ui remains perpetually in need of more and better "polish", and the list
of planned features is long.

<ul>
<li> integration of IVIB and Ui -- like other languages' IDE's.
<li> Emacs mode -- ground work for programmable keybindings has been laid.
<li> integration of UDB
</ul>
