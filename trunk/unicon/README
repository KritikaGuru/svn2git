Unicon 11.x README


This is the Unicon distribution.  Please tell us
where it compiles, and when and how it doesn't.

This distribution unpacks into a directory hierarchy per the Icon source
distribution, with additions. General instructions for building Icon
sources apply; see their technical report if you need it.


Recently Supported Platforms	Mostly Supported Platforms
----------------------------------------------------------
intel_linux, amd64_linux	other UNIX
intel_macos, ppc_macos
solaris_ss64
MS Windows XP and Vista		MS Windows95 and above


Sample install:

unzip uni.zip				# maybe you've done this already
+
make Configure name=intel_linux		# use your OS name from config/unix
-or-
make X-Configure name=intel_linux	# if you have X11 libs/headers
+
make Unicon

Should create a bin directory.  Total success will place icont, iconx,
unicon, and ivib in that directory, which you should add to your path.

Tips: Your platform may need custom tweaking if it doesn't have an
<ndbm.h>; if your NDBM library has a 1024 byte limit you will not
be able to build ivib. Use the supplied gdbm, or your own, to get
around system ndbm issues.
