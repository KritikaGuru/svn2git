#
# Current semantics of asterisk will match the shortest match possible first,
# and only consider non-empty iterations of the pattern if the 0-iteration
# match fails for some reason, so almost all these tests are no-ops. Switching
# to a new semantics might make these tests more meaningful.
#

#
# These tests of asterisk on various basic tokens are well and good, but
# asterisk needs to be tested on (parenthesized) complex expressions with
# alternations and concatenations inside, and nested non-immediate asterisks.
# Examples (abc | (de*d) | xyz ghi)*
