# Expected output is
# actinium:ac:89:227*:1899:debierne
#
# Status: compile (semantic) error caused by line that assigns to p,
#  if a person does not have latest/current unigram.{icn,u}, which
#  are not committed yet due to the need to rebuild yyerror.
#  Workaround is to parenthesize (Break(" ") -> chars).
