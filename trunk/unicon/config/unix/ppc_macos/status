System configuration:

Latest Icon version:

	Version 9.4.1

Installer:

	Icon Project
	The University of Arizona

Missing features:

	Loadable C functions.  The "cfuncs" test will fail.

Known bugs:

	None.

Comments:

	Icon runs on Darwin, which is (loosely speaking) the
	command-line-based Unix substructure of MacOS X.

	An Icon installation with graphics requires the presence
	of XFree86; see (e.g.)
	    http://xfree86.org/
	    http://www.xdarwin.org/
	    http://www.darwinfo.org/howto/x.shtml
	    http://www.mrcla.com/XonX/

	To install Icon without graphics, use "make Configure"
	instead of "make X-Configure" when building.

	Tested with MacOS 10.1 and 10.1.2.
	Graphics tested with XFree86 4.1.2.
