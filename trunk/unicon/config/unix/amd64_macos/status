System configuration:

	Apple Intel-based Macintosh running MacOS X Snow Leopard (10.6)
	Named amd64_macos to be consistent with amd64_linux (AMD invented
	the 64-bit x86 instruction set).

Latest Unicon version:

	Version 11.6

Installer:

	Clint Jeffery
	Unicon Project

Missing features:

	Loadable C functions.  The "cfuncs" test will fail.

Known bugs:

	(g)dbm errors cause some unicon class translations to fail!
	This is bad enough that the basic Unicon class libraries
	fail (in 'make uni/lib'), preventing ivib and other builds.

Comments:

	Extremely preliminary, not yet tested!

	Until a 64-bit intel macos rswitch is available, uses pthreads
	for co-expressions, which of course are very very slow.  udb
	debugger and other co-expression based tools will be slow.

	A Unicon installation with graphics requires the presence of X11,
	in 10.5 it was bundled with the OS.

	To install Icon without graphics, use "make Configure name=amd64_macos"
	instead of "make X-Configure name=amd64_macos" when building.
