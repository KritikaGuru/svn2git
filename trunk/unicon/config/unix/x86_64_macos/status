System configuration:

	Apple 64-bit Intel-based Macintosh running MacOS X Snow Leopard (10.6)

Latest Unicon version:

	Version 12.0

Installer:

	Clint Jeffery
	Unicon Project

Missing features:

	Loadable C functions.  The "cfuncs" test will fail.

Comments:

	Until a 64-bit intel macos rswitch is available, uses pthreads
	for co-expressions, which of course are very very slow.  udb
	debugger and other co-expression based tools will be slow.

	A Unicon installation with graphics requires the presence of X11,
	which is bundled with the OS by default.
