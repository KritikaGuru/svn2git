System configuration:

	Apple 64-bit Intel-based Macintosh running MacOS X Mavericks (10.9.2)

Latest Unicon version:

	Version 12.3

Installer:

	Clint Jeffery
	Unicon Project

Missing features:

	icode compression, and built-in ability to read/write compressed
	files, are missing due to memory violations out of the box in libz
	on Mavericks (and later)

Comments:

	Until a 64-bit intel macos rswitch is available, uses pthreads
	for co-expressions, which of course are very very slow.  udb
	debugger and other co-expression based tools will be slow.

	A Unicon installation with graphics requires the presence of X11,
	which is free (XQuartz) but not bundled with the OS by default.
